title: Course Material

# Welcome!
This is a website that I ([Peter Larsson-Green](https://ju.se/en/personinfo.html?sign=LarPet)) use in my work at [Jönköping University](https://ju.se/en.html) where I teach in various courses involving programming. Here I upload course material students can take part of in their studies. If you're curious, feel free to look around at the various courses and lectures.

## Getting help
If you need help in any of the courses, [open an issue about it on GitHub](https://github.com/PeppeL-G/course-material/issues). I will try to answer your questions there as soon as possible. Students are also encouraged to answer each other's questions, but **don't give away solutions for free**. Instead just **help each other as little possible**, so the one asking the question will do most of her work on her own.
