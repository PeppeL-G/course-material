# Layered Architecture in Node.js
How should applications with a large code base be structured so it's:

* Easy to understand how it's been structured.
* Easy to add new features to it.
* Easy to test the code in it.
* Etc.

? Well, using a layered architecture seems like a good solution, let's take a look at what that is and how we can use it in a Node.js application.

* [The Wikipedia article Multitier architecture](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multitier_architecture)
    * Note: The article is primarily about *tiers*, which is not the same as *layers* (difference explain in the article), but it's the same kind of thinking
