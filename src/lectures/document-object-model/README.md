# Document Object Model
In the Browser Object Model there exists a special variable called `document` that represents the webpage rendered on the screen (you can almost think of it as the HTML code). Through this variable we can listen for when the user interacts with the webpage (clicks on links, submit forms, etc.) and change the webpage dynamically (add/remove HTML elements).
