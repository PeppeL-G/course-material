* Peter

Justify your answer.

Peter
Worst answer, no justification provided. 0 points.

Peter, because it starts with a capital P
Better answer, but not a valid justification (could just as well be *peter, because it start with a lowercase p*). 0 points.

Peter, because it consists of 5 characters.
Better answer, but the (implicit) grammar rule *Words consisting of 5 characters should start with uppercase character* does not exist. 0 points.

Peter, because there's a grammar rule stating that characters consisting of 5 characters should start with an uppercase character.
Better answer, because the grammar rule is explicitly stated. Unfortunately, that grammar rule doesn't exist. 0 points.

Peter, because it's a name.
Better answer, because the justification is correct that Peter is a name, but still doesn't say why it should start with a capital P (*peter* is a name too, why is that wrong?), 0 or 0.5 points.

Peter, because it's a name, and the English grammar states all names should start with a capital letter.
Best answer, because *Peter* is identified as a name, and then justify that it should start with a capital letter because there's a grammatical rule in the English language that says all names should start with a capital letter. 1 point

(to be really scientific, one should provide a source to the claim *All names should according to the English grammar start with a capital letter*, but this is just an exam answer, and not a scientific report, so won't do that)

The student has successfully taken two true statements (*Peter is a name* and *All names should according to the English grammar start with a capital letter*) and used logic to deduce a new true statement ("Peter is spelled with a capital P in the beginning").
