# Android SQLite Database
So, your application collects data from the user that you need to store somewhere? Why not in an SQlite database? Android has built-in support for that one, so why not?

::: warning Room 
The lecture shows the old way we communicated with SQLite databases in Android. A few years back Google released [the Room library](https://developer.android.com/jetpack/androidx/releases/room) (an Object Relational Mapping library) we can use to more easily communicate with the database. However, it's still good to have knowledge about the old way, since many old applications use it.
