# Svelte
Svelte is a frontend framework we can use to implement Single-Page Applications in a very convenient way. There is no recording for this lecture. Instead, use their excellent [Tutorial](https://svelte.dev/tutorial/basics) to learn the basics of Svelte. You don't need to read of it, but at least the following parts:

* (1) Introduction
* (2) Reactivity
* (3) Props
* (4) Logic
* (5) Events
* (6) Bindings
* (7) Lifecycle
* (8) Stores
* (13) Advanced styling
