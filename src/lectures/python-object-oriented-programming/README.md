# Python Object-Oriented Programming
So far in the course we have primarily used *imperative programming* (a program consists of a sequence of statements to be executed), but we have also used a bit *object-oriented programming* since each value in Python actually is an object. In this lecture we take a closer look at what an object is and how we can describe them using classes.
