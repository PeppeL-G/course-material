# After Peter's Exam
Here are instructions on what students should do after they have received back an exam marked by me.

## Double check my marking
I'm only a human; I can do mistake. Therefor you should double check that I haven't marked your answers wrong. For each question on the exam I've written a sample answer and marking guidelines. You should find a link to it in a recent announcement on Canvas, but also from the study guide/one of the pages linked to from the study guide.

If you think you have an answer that has received too few points based on the marking guidelines, send me an email at [peter.larsson-green@ju.se](mailto:peter.larsson-green@ju.se) and tell me which answer and a motivation for why you think that answer deserves more points (based on my sample answer and my marking guidelines). Use the template in <FigureNumber /> below for the email.

You may do this for at most 3 questions. If I give you more points on any of those 3 questions, you may send me 3 more questions, and so one.

::: danger You can lose points too!
When I check your answers a second time, it can just as well be that I give you fewer points on an answer than what I initially gave you. So if you're smart you ask me to only double check answer you are quite certain you deserve more points on.
:::

::: danger Contact me ASAP!
You have only a few days to ask me to double check my marking of some of your answers. After a few days I'll report your result to Ladok, so make sure to send me the email before then.
:::

::: warning Why only 3 answers?
Most students that think they deserve to get more points on their answers don't get that. If you don't get more points on any of the three answers you are most confident you can get more points on, then you won't get more points on any of your other answers as well.

## General discussion
Of course you can also send me an email at [peter.larsson-green@ju.se](mailto:peter.larsson-green@ju.se) to ask general questions about the exam or if there's something about the exam you just want to discuss.
