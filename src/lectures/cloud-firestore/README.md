# Cloud Firestore
Cloud Firestore is one of Firebase's services. It is a very scalable NoSQL database we can use to store our data in. You can also listen for when the data is changed in the database by another client, and then immediately fetch the updated data. Using Firebase Authentication we can also add authorization rules to indicate what operations each client is allowed to carry out.
