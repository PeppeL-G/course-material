# Client-side JavaScript & BOM
Web browsers can not only render HTML code styled with CSS, they can also execute JavaScript code. JavaScript is a really simple language that on its own can only be used for computations, so it does for example not contain any input/output functionality. But when our JavaScript code is executed by a web browser it will be executed in an environment where the web browser has added some extra goodies we can use. This environment is known as the *Browser Object Model* (BOM).
