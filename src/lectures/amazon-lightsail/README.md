# Amazon Lightsail
So, you have implemented a great web application in Node.js, and now you want to have it up and running on the Internet, but how? Let's see how we can make that happen using [Amazon Lightsail](https://aws.amazon.com/lightsail/).

::: danger Cloning private a repository from GitHub
In the video below, I clone a public repository on GitHub, so I don't need to authenticate myself. If you try to clone a private repository from GitHub, you need to authenticate yourself to GitHub with your GitHub username and a GitHub Personal Access Token (instead of your password). To create a GitHub Personal Access Token, follow the step on GiHub's page [Creating a personal access token](https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/keeping-your-account-and-data-secure/creating-a-personal-access-token), and then use that Personal Access Token when you should enter your GitHub password.
