# Welcome!
Welcome to the course *Android Development*! In this course you'll learn how to create Android applications. 

::: danger Corona restrictions
Due to the current pandemic, all teaching (lectures, lab sessions, etc.) will be conducted online, and students are encouraged to study from home if possible. For more information, read JU's page [Updated information regarding the coronavirus](https://ju.se/en/about-us/jonkoping-university/information-material/updated-information-regarding-the-coronavirus.html).
:::

This website will be used to host the course material only. If you take this course, you must also join [the course's Canvas page](https://ju.instructure.com/courses/3421). Students registered for this course should have been added to that page automatically. The Canvas page will be used to keep track of your progress in the course, to distribute you among the lab session groups, to handle submission of your project work, etc. You should only need to use Canvas when you are instructed to do that on this website (e.g. when submitting your project work). You will also receive information through announcements posted on Canvas, so you probably want to make sure notifications (through email or push notifications to the Canvas Android/iOS app) for those events are enable on Canvas.

::: warning Note to old students
If you're an old student that took this course a previous year but still have some examination tests left to pass you take those tests as they are described this year. The old Ping Pong event won't be used any more, so join this year's Canvas page, so we can keep track of your progress in the course this year there. If you aren't registered for the course this year, ask the course coordinator to invite you to the Canvas page by sending him an email message based on the template in <FigureNumber /> below with the topic `Invitation to Canvas Course` to `peter.larsson-green@ju.se`.

::: danger Swedish VS International Students
The Swedish students from the following programs:

* Software Engineering and Mobile Platforms
* Embedded Systems

Will in the next study period take the course [Gruppdynamik (TGYG19, 3 Credits)](https://ju.se/studera/kurser.html?courseCode=TGYG19&semester=20191&revision=1,000&lang=sv). That course is about reflecting upon and improving your skills of working in a group, and for that course you should have a diary describing your experiences from working in a group. That diary is something you will produce in this course as part of your project work.

More information about this later, but what's important for you to know now is that:

* Swedish students will not work with international students in this course (the project work groups you use in this course will be used in the Gruppdynamik course as well).
* Swedish students failing to participate in the project work in this course will have a hard time passing the Gruppdynamik course since they won't have a diary of good enough quality to use in that course.
