# Welcome!
Welcome to the course *Android Development*! In this course you'll learn how to create Android applications. 

This website will be used to host the course material only. Canvas will primarily be used to:

* Send info to you through announcements (be sure to have your global notification settings or your course notification settings enabled)
* Organize you into lab groups (see the People page)
* Keep track of your progress in the course (passed lab assignments) (see the Modules page and the Grades page)

Read the [Study Guide](./study-guide/) for the details.

::: warning Swedish VS International Students
The Swedish students from the following programs:

* Software Engineering and Mobile Platforms
* Embedded Systems

Will in the next study period take the course [Gruppdynamik (TGYG19, 3 Credits)](https://ju.se/studera/kurser.html?courseCode=TGYG19&semester=20191&revision=1,000&lang=sv). That course is about reflecting upon and improving your skills of working in a group, and for that course you should have a diary describing your experiences from working in a group. That diary is something you will produce in this course as part of your project work.

More information about this later, but what's important for you to know now is that:

* Swedish students will not work with international students in this course (the project work groups you use in this course will be used in the Gruppdynamik course as well).
* Swedish students failing to participate in the project work in this course will have a hard time passing the Gruppdynamik course since they won't have a diary of good enough quality to use in that course.

## Information to old students
If you're an old student that took this course a previous year but still have some examination tests left to pass you take those tests as they are described this year. The old Canvas course won't be used any more, so join this year's Canvas course, so we can keep track of your progress in the course this year there. If you aren't registered for the course this year, ask the course coordinator to invite you to the Canvas course by sending him an email message based on the template in <FigureNumber /> below with the topic `Invitation to Canvas Course` to `peter.larsson-green@ju.se`.
