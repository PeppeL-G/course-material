# Feedback 2022
Here is the written feedback from students when the course ran 2022, together with my comments.



## My opinion about the course material (e.g. course literature, scientific literature, recorded lectures, web quizes, instructions for laborations).
>Its way better to have the recording than doing it live in a classroom
>There is so much information that you later can review and re-watch to learn.
>This course should ALWAYS have recorded "tutorials". Not only during the pandemic. 

I agree that there are benefits with using recorded tutorials instead of lectures on campus, but I fear some students will find the course way too boring if it would only have one introductory lecture, so I try to have a few of them. But maybe I'm wrong. You are 3 in each project group, maybe that's enough "social hangout" for you, and lectures aren't needed.




## This worked really well in the course.
>Fantastic communication between the teacher and students, very nice and informative.

>The recorded tutorials were great, it was perfect to have the posibillity to go back and listen to difficult parts several times.
>
>The requirements of the app was super clear, but at the same time there was much room for creativity.

>Good lab assistant

>Most of the things. The course keeps a very high standard and is of extremely high quality.

>Just focusing on labs and project is ok. Way better than the web-dev course, that course is not humane.





## The course has room for improvement in the following areas.
>Unless the student is personaly interested in web / database things, do not expect the students from Dis to know what and how xml works, how a database works or what the lingo of databases means.
>I found it very frustrating working with xml and databases without even a slight introduction in any of the tutorials.

XML is quite simple, and I have assumed that students can keep up. I can't remember any student having asked me any questions about it this or previous years, nor that I've got any feedback about it's being hard to learn and understand any previous year. But one of the points with having tutorials is that you can ask questions at them. Why didn't you ask for clarification?

And about databases, not all students use databases in their projects, so therefore I don't cover them at the tutorials, but instead in the recorded lectures. What did you not learn there?

And it's up to the students to come up with what to do as projects. I can't cover all different details all different groups need to use, partly because I don't know what students will do in advance, partly because I wouldn't have time to cover all of it anyway. I try to focus on the basics most students can have use of, and students are expected to be able to learn additional details on their own. For this you also have lab sessions as support, where you can come and ask for help.



>It was difficult to use the information received in the pre-recorded lectures. The ones with programming was in Java and for me as a beginner they did not help a lot. The 100% theoretical was good though.
>
>The non recorded lectures was way too fast and complicated. This tempo works if recorded, but not in real lecturing (thinking about the bluetooth one). As a beginner in android i would prefer slower and more explaining lectures

The reason some of the recorded lectures is in Java and why some of it is in Kotlin: The Java lectures were recorded before Google recommended using Kotlin for Android projects. I haven't updated those to Kotlin because of multiple reasons:

* When starting a new Android project, one should preferably use Kotlin. But many existing Android projects are written in Java, and you (the students) might end up having to work on such projects. So I think it makes sense to also include some Java in the course
* I reason that those that have used programming for 1.5 years should not have big difficulties understanding code written in two different languages, so I don't think it should be a big difficulty for you that parts of the course material is in Java, and parts of it is in Kotlin
* I have limited time, so even if I would want to update a Java lecture to Kotlin, there are other parts of the course I would need to cut down on, and I don't think it's worth that



>I felt that the lab didnt teach enough to help me through the project. I had a lot of questions. It was also hard having two projects at the same (web advanced).

The lab is not intended to teach you everything you need to know to complete the project. It is supposed to help you learn the basics of implementing an Android app with a GUI, which covers the basics of any Android app. After completing the lab, you should have learned enough to get started with the project, but not enough to complete the project. You will most likely need to learn some stuff on your own to be able to complete the project (since different students do different projects, I can't cover everything all students need to learn in the course).

You are expected to have questions, so you having many questions I don't see as anything bad. Asking questions is a great way to learn. The course contains both tutorials and lab sessions where you can ask questions to a teacher and get help. 




>DMP has both Android Development and Web Advanced at the same time. The amount of work that has to go in to both courses are far greater than most other courses that are 7.5hp. This is not a bad thing, just that these two courses should not be at the same time. I began working on both projects immediately, everyday of the week, and still had too put in around 100 hours the last week to meet deadline. Both of these courses are great, and I have personally learned learn alot from them, but having them at the same time is brutal.

Both courses are quite programming intensive with much programming as pre-requisites which not all students have fully mastered yet, and that makes the courses harder for many students than a course in general should be. And because of this, if you have difficulties with one of them due to lacking programming pre-requisite, you will also have difficulties with the other one. I suspect this is the main reason why some students don't think they have enough time to complete the courses on time.

I also know that having two big projects at the same time is not optimal. Feedback from students taking the course previous years have indicated the same problem. I've talked about this with the manager of my department, but he says it's impossible to move the courses. So I'm afraid we can't do anything about that.




>The project members and I spent 6 days a week in school during the time period of the course. Around 8-10 hours in school Monday to Saturday. Otherwise It would be impossible to have a shot at completing one of the two classes. 3 days of Android and 3 days of Web. I am so extremely tired afterwards. Only having 1 day of rest instead of 2 really drains your energy.

>To improve this class, just do even more detailed example videos - show and explain code and how it works.

You are expected to put down 200 hours of work in a 7.5 credits course to pass it. Most students need to put down **at least** this many hours, and if you don't know all of the pre-requisites (which is very common for a course with this many pre-requisites), you will definitely need to put down more hours than this.

I agree it's bad that you have two big projects in two different courses in parallel, see my previous comment above.

I don't want to do detailed videos with detailed code. Then students would just copy me without understanding what they are doing (*Monkey see, monkey do*). Therefor I prefer keeping the videos more theoretical and teach concepts, and then the students need to figure out the details themselves when implementing the concepts. And learning how to solve problems on your own is very important for engineers (which is what we should help you become). When working in the industry, your boss won't tell you *solve the problem by doing it like this*, but will simply tell you *solve the problem*, and then you must come up with the solution. You need to practice that already here in the school, and therefor I don't want to give you too many details on how to accomplish things.
