<SetTitle title="Introduction to Script Programming 2020" />

# Welcome!
Welcome to the course *Introduction to Script Programming*! In this course you'll learn how to create small programs in Python your computer can execute.

This website will be used to host the course material, and Canvas will be used to kep track of the students' progress in the course (e.g. passed laboratory work), make announcements, etc.

::: danger Corona restrictions
This course will have less than 50 students, so the course will be given at campus as usual. But it's very important (for both teachers and students) to follow the Public Health Agency of Sweden (Folkh√§lsomyndigheten) recommendations and stay home if you're feeling ill. Read more on [their website](https://www.folkhalsomyndigheten.se/the-public-health-agency-of-sweden/communicable-disease-control/covid-19/#_69327).

::: warning Two course codes!
This course is primarily given for two programs, and they have different codes for this course:

* The bachelor program *IT Infrastructure and Network Design* use the course code `TSPG17`.
* The master program *Sustainable Building Information Management* use the course code `TSTG17`.

At the moment, the only difference between these two are some of the problems that should be solved in the laboratory work. Those problems have been pointed out in the instructions for the laboratory work.

::: danger Note to "IT Infrastructure and Network Design" students
Starting autumn 2020, the bachelor students from *IT Infrastructure and Network Design* read this course in Year 2. This means the course doesn't run for the students from this program this year (autumn 2020). However, you can however still present your laboratory work at a lab session and write the exam (for more details, see the separate email message sent to you).
:::

::: warning Note to old students
If you're an old student that took this course a previous year but still have some examination tests left to pass you take those tests as they are described this year. The old Ping Pong event won't be used any more, so join this year's Canvas Course, so we can keep track of your progress in the course this year there. If you aren't registered for the course this year, ask the course manager to invite you to the Canvas Course by sending him an email message based on the template in <FigureNumber /> below with the topic `Invitation to Canvas Course` to `peter.larsson-green@ju.se`.
