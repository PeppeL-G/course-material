# Exam 2022-02-13
Here you find the questions, sample answers and marking guidelines for the exam 2022-02-13.

## Information
Start by reading through all questions. Max score is 30 points.

* For grade 3, 40% of max score (12 points) is required.
* For grade 4, 60% of max score (18 points) is required.
* For grade 5, 80% of max score (24 points) is required.

During the test, you are only allowed to use:

* The computer you sit at to only answer the questions on this exam (you may not run any other program).
* A dictionary to translate to/from English from/to your native language.
* Pen and paper to sketch things (does not need to be submitted).

Write your answers in either English or Swedish. If you write your answers in Swedish, make sure to not introduce any translation confusement. **Write proper sentences (spelling, upper/lower case characters, punctuation, etc.).** Answers that do not do this good enough/are vague/are ununderstandable cannot receive full score on the questions.

Answers that are more or less copies of sample answers given to you or copies of text found somewhere else will be rewarded 0 points. Use your own words to answer the questions.

Good luck!

## Question 6 (1p)
:::: exam-question-container
::: exam-question

Which one of the following statements is a bad suggestion on how to represent data?

* To represent the number of trees in a wood, one can use an integer, e.g. `number_of_trees = 974`
* To represent a tree of a specific type and an age (in years), one can use a list containing a string and an integer, e.g. `tree = ["Oak", 21]`
* To represent a tree with a length (how tall it is in centimeter), one can use an integer, e.g. `tree_length = 623`
* To represent the radius of a tree (in centimeters), one can use an integer, e.g. `tree_radius = 10`
* To represent the names of different tree types, one can use a list with strings, e.g. `tree_type_names = ["Oak", "Birch"]`
* All other statements are good ways of representing data

## Question 8 (1p)
:::: exam-question-container
::: exam-question

Explain why it's often better to create functions and writing your code in them, instead of writing code without creating your own functions.

:::
::: exam-sample-answer

By putting your code in a function you can re-use it multiple times by calling the function. If the code is not inside a function, you can't re-use it.

:::
::: exam-marking-guidelines

* 1 point for re-using code, or:
* 1 point for code easier to test, or:
* 1 point for code better structured/easier to read
* -0.1 points for not starting a sentence with uppercase character
* -0.25 points for each described thing that isn't relevant/I can't understand

## Question 9 (1p)
:::: exam-question-container
::: exam-question

What integers should be assigned to the variables `x` and `y` to slice out the values `"c"` and `"d"` in the code below?

```python
my_list = ["a", "b", "c", "d", "e"]
x = ?
y = ?
my_new_list = my_list[x:y]
# my_new_list should now be ["c", "d"]

## Question 11 (1p)
:::: exam-question-container
::: exam-question

Write the following code:

```python
my_list = [x*x for x in range(5, 10) if is_odd(7.5)]
```

As code making use of a loop instead of a list comprehension expression. Your own code should have the exact same meaning as the code above.

:::
::: exam-sample-answer

```python
my_list = []

## Question 12 (1p)
:::: exam-question-container
::: exam-question

Here is a quite complex structure with information about different movies:

```python
movies = {
    "action": [
        {"name": "GoldenEye", "runtime": 110},
        {"name": "Mission Impossible", "runtime": 115},
        {"name": "Pearl Harbor", "runtime": 160}
    ],
    "drama": [
        {"name": "Titanic", "runtime": 180},
        {"name": "Love Actually", "runtime": 120}
    ]
}
```

Given this structure, write an **expression** that evaluates to the name of the movie with the runtime `160`, i.e. `Pearl Harbor`.

**Note**: Do not write a statement, and simply writing `Pearl Harbor` is of course not OK; the value needs to be retrieved from the structure.

:::
::: exam-sample-answer

`movies["action"][2]["name"]`

}, {
    "name": "Bob's home",
    "color": "lime"
}]
```

Can be expressed in XML format.

:::
::: exam-sample-answer

    </house>
    <house>
        <name>Bob's home</name>
        <color>lime</color>
    </house>
</houses>
```

houses = [{
    "name": "Alice's castle",
    "color": "red"
}, {
    "name": "Bob's home",
    "color": "lime"

## Question 15 (1p)
:::: exam-question-container
::: exam-question

Explain the difference between a function printing its result, and a function returning its result. Which one is usually better to use, and why?

:::
::: exam-sample-answer

If a function computes a result and then prints it (i.e. shows the result in the shell/terminal/console), then the function can only be used for computing and printing the result. If the function instead of printing returns the result, then the one calling the function can decide what should happen with the result (printing it, storing it in a file, use it in another computation, etc.), and the function can be re-used in many more situations, so returning the result is usually better than printing the result.

:::
::: exam-marking-guidelines

* 0.5 points for explaining the difference/each type of function
* 0.5 points for correct motivation which one is usually best
* Point reductions:
    * -0.1 points for not starting sentence with uppercase character
    * -0.25 points for each claim that is false

## Question 17 (1p)
:::: exam-question-container
::: exam-question

Implement the function `get_weekday_number`, which receives a string as argument representing the name of a weekday, and returns the number of the week that weekday is. You need to support the weekdays shown in the table below. 

| Weekday name | Weekday number |
|---|---|
| Monday | 1 |
| Tuesday | 2 |
| Wednesday | 3 |
| Thursday | 4 |
| Friday | 5 |
| Saturday | 6 |
| Sunday | 7 |

If the received name is not one of those in the table, `-1` should be returned.

Sample usage:

```
get_weekday_number("Thursday")   â†’   4
get_weekday_number("Christmas Day")   â†’   -1
```

:::
::: exam-sample-answer

```python
weekday_numbers = {

## Question 18 (2p)
:::: exam-question-container
::: exam-question

Write a program that keeps asking the user to enter a word (a string not containing a space character) until the user enters `stop`. If the user enters more than one word (i.e. a string containing the space character), print an error message to the user. The program should print the number of single words the user entered. When running the program, it can look like this (bold text represents text entered by the user).

<div style="font-family: 'Courier New';">

Enter a word or stop: **car**\
Enter a word or stop: **table**\
Enter a word or stop: **yellow sun**\
No, 'yellow sun' is not a single word.
Enter a word or stop: **Floor**\
Enter a word or stop: **stop**\
You entered 3 single words.

</div>

**Note**: The output should have the very same format as in the example above (including white-spaces, but with the exception of the boldness of the input, of course).

:::
::: exam-sample-answer

```python
number_of_single_words_entered = 0
entered_text = ""

while entered_text != "stop":
    
    entered_text = input("Enter a word or stop: ")
    
    if entered_text != "stop":
        
        if " " in entered_text:
            print("No, '"+entered_text+"' is not a single word.")
            # Or (to get rid of the line break):
            # print("No, '"+entered_text+"' is not a single word.", end=" ")
        else:
            number_of_single_words_entered += 1

print("You entered "+str(number_of_single_words_entered)+" single words.")
```
:::
::: exam-marking-guidelines

**The intention was the example would contain an extra line break. Solutions that do respective do not contain the missing line break in the example will be accepted (see the comment in the sample answer).**

## Question 21 (3p)
:::: exam-question-container
::: exam-question

Below is some data about houses owned by some humans.

```python
houses = [
   {"owner": "Alice", "name": "Alice's Palace", "number_of_rooms": 9, "number_of_windows": 20},
   {"owner": "Alice", "name": "Alice's Home",   "number_of_rooms": 3, "number_of_windows": 5},
   {"owner": "Alice", "name": "Alice's Cabin",  "number_of_rooms": 1, "number_of_windows": 4},
   {"owner": "Bob",   "name": "Bob's Home",     "number_of_rooms": 4, "number_of_windows": 16},
   {"owner": "Bob",   "name": "Bob's Cabin",    "number_of_rooms": 1, "number_of_windows": 1}
]
```

It's warm in the summer, and to cool down one can open all the windows in the houses. However, people are lazy and don't want to do that themselves, so they pay someone to open all the windows for them. That someone charges:

* 100 SEK to visit a house...
* ...+ 10 SEK each for each room he needs to enter in the house...
* ...+ 20 SEK each for each window he opens

Each room contains at least 1 window.

Write code that first computes which human that must pay the highest total cost to open all windows in all the houses she owns, and then prints the cost of the most expensive house that human owns. The correct answer for the data given above is `590`.

**Note**: Your code should still work as expected if one adds/removes houses to/from the list. `Alice` and `Bob` are not the only ones who can own a house.

    )

# Find the owner with the highest cost.
highest_cost = -1
highest_cost_owner = ""

for owner in costs_by_owner:
    cost = costs_by_owner[owner]
    if highest_cost < cost:

        highest_cost_owner = owner

# Find the houses owned by that owner.
houses_to_consider = [house for house in houses if house["owner"] == highest_cost_owner]

# Find the most expensive house.

    )
    
    if highest_cost < cost:
        highest_cost = cost

# Show the result.
print("The most expensive house owned by the one paying the most costs "+str(highest_cost)+".")

## Question 22 (2p)
:::: exam-question-container
::: exam-question

The class `Lock` represents a lock that can be unlocked by the correct 4 digit code. The one creating a new instance of the class gets to decide which the correct code should be. One can then pass one digit at a time to the lock, and when the last 4 digits passed to lock are the same as the correct code, the lock should be unlocked. Passing a (wrong) digit to the lock after that should lock it again.

The class `Lock` has the following constructor/methods:

| Constructor/Method | Description |
|---|---|
| `Lock(correct_code)` | Creates a new lock (that is locked) with the given `correct_code` (string containing 4 digits). |
| `is_unlocked()` | Returns `True` if the last 4 digits passed to the lock is the correct code, otherwise `False` |
| `try_unlock(digit)` | Passes the `digit` (number) to the lock in an attempt to unlock it. |

Write a program making use of the class. In the program, the correct code should be `0321`. You should then ask the user to enter a digit at a time until the lock unlocks.

Sample usage:

<div style="font-family: monospace; padding-left: 2em;">

Enter next digit to use in the lock: **5**\
Enter next digit to use in the lock: **3**\
Enter next digit to use in the lock: **1**\
Enter next digit to use in the lock: **7**\
Enter next digit to use in the lock: **2**\
Enter next digit to use in the lock: **0**\
Enter next digit to use in the lock: **3**\
Enter next digit to use in the lock: **2**\
Enter next digit to use in the lock: **1**\
The lock is now unlocked!

</div>

**Note**: The output should look precisely as in the example above (including white-spaces, but with the exception of the boldness from the input, of course).

**Note**: No error handling is needed; you can expect the user to always enter a digit.

while not lock.is_unlocked():
    
    next_digit = int(input("Enter next digit to use in the lock: "))

* 2 points for an answer that largely works
* Point reduction for errors:
    * -0.1 points for passing string to `try_unlock()`
    * -0.25 points for not using `0321` as the correct code
    * -0.25 points for not passing the correct code as a string
    * -0.25 points for each badly named variable (e.g. `start` or `test` for the lock object)
    * -0.25 points for not using `()` when calling a method
    * -1 point for doing unnecessary things, such as storing user input in a list yourself

## Question 23 (2p)
:::: exam-question-container
::: exam-question

The class `Lock` represents a lock that can be unlocked by the correct 4 digit code. The one creating a new instance of the class gets to decide which the correct code should be. One can then pass one digit at a time to the lock, and when the last 4 digits passed to lock are the same as the correct code, the lock should be unlocked. Passing a (wrong) digit to the lock after that should lock it again.

The class `Lock` has the following constructor/methods:

| Constructor/Method | Description |
|---|---|
| `Lock(correct_code)` | Creates a new lock (that is locked) with the given `correct_code` (string containing 4 digits). |
| `is_unlocked()` | Returns `True` if the last 4 digits passed to the lock is the correct code, otherwise `False` |
| `try_unlock(digit)` | Passes the `digit` (number) to the lock in an attempt to unlock it. |

Implement the `Lock` class per the description above.

```python
class Lock:
    
    def __init__(self, correct_code):
        self.correct_code = correct_code
        self.tried_digits = []
    
    def is_unlocked(self):
        
        code_length = len(self.correct_code)
        
        if len(self.tried_digits) < code_length:
            return False
        
        for correct_index in range(code_length):
            test_index = len(self.tried_digits) - code_length + correct_index
            if self.correct_code[correct_index] != self.tried_digits[test_index]:
                return False
        
        return True
    
    def try_unlock(self, digit):
        self.tried_digits.append(str(digit))
```

* 0.5 points for having the constructor, methods and all parameters correct
* 1.5 points for largely having the implementation of the constructor and all methods correct
* Point reduction for errors:
    * -0.1 points for not converting `digit` parameter to string
    * -0.25 points for missing the `self` parameter
    * -0.25 points for initializing an instance variable in a method instead of constructor
    * -0.5 points for changing instance variables in `is_unlocked()`
    * -0.75 points for code crashing when less than 4 digits have been entered
