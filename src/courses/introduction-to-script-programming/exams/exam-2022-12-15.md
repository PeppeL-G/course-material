# Exam 2022-12-15
Here you find the questions, sample answers and marking guidelines for the exam 2022-12-15.

## Information
Start by reading through all questions. Peter will visit the exam 45 minutes after it has started to answer any questions you might have.

~~Max score is 25 points.~~

* ~~For grade 3, 40% of max score (10 points) is required~~
* ~~For grade 4, 60% of max score (15 points) is required~~
* ~~For grade 5, 80% of max score (20 points) is required~~

::: danger Question 5 is discarded
Question 5 contains an error, and has therefor been discarded. The new max score is therefor 24 points, and the thresholds for the grades are instead:

* For grade 3, 40% of max score (9.6 points) is required
* For grade 4, 60% of max score (14.4 points) is required
* For grade 5, 80% of max score (19.2 points) is required

:::

During the test, you are only allowed to use:

* The computer you sit at to only answer the questions on this exam (you may not run any other program)
* A dictionary to translate to/from English from/to your native language
* Pen and paper to sketch/write notes with (does not need to be submitted)

Write your answers in either English or Swedish. If you write your answers in Swedish, make sure to not introduce any translation confusement. **Write proper sentences (spelling, upper/lower case characters, punctuation, etc.).** Answers that do not do this good enough/are vague/are ununderstandable cannot receive full score on the questions.

Answers that are more or less copies of sample answers given to you or copies of text found somewhere else will be rewarded 0 points. Use your own words to answer the questions (does not apply to questions where you write code).

Good luck!


## Question 1 (1p)
:::: exam-question-container
::: exam-question

Place the following lines of code in such order they can be executed (read underscores as white-spaces/indentation (Inspera doesn't allow the text to begin with white-spaces ðŸ˜ž)).

* `____doubled = x * 2`
* `print(str(normal)+"*2 = "+str(doubled))`
* `doubled = get_doubled(normal)`
* `____return doubled`
* `def get_doubled(x):`
* `normal = float(input("Enter a number: "))`

You will get:

* 1 point for all in correct order

:::
::: exam-sample-answer

```python
def get_doubled(x):
____doubled = x * 2
____return doubled
normal = float(input("Enter a number: ")) # Placing this line at the top works too.
doubled = get_doubled(normal)
print(str(normal)+"*2 = "+str(doubled))
```

## Question 6 (1p)
:::: exam-question-container
::: exam-question

Which one of the following statements is a bad suggestion on how to represent data?

* To represent the names of many students, one can use a list with strings, e.g. `student_names = ["Alice", "Bob"]`
* To represent an animal of a certain type and an age (in years), one can use a list containing a string and an integer, e.g. `animal = ["cat", 7]`
* To represent the number of humans in a house, one can use an integer, e.g. `number_of_humans = 4`
* To represent a cat with a name and an age (in years), one can use a dictionary with a string and an integer, e.g. `cat = {"name": "Catty", age: 3}`
* To represent the age of the oldest student in a class, one can use an integer, e.g. `highest_age_in_class = 29`
* All other statements are good ways of representing data

## Question 10 (1p)
:::: exam-question-container
::: exam-question

Here is a quite complex structure with information about different movies:

```python
movies = {
    "action": [
        {"name": "GoldenEye", "runtime": 110},
        {"name": "Mission Impossible", "runtime": 115},
        {"name": "Pearl Harbor", "runtime": 160}
    ],
    "drama": [
        {"name": "Titanic", "runtime": 180},
        {"name": "Love Actually", "runtime": 120}
    ]
}
```

Given this very structure, write an **expression** that evaluates to the name of the movie with the runtime `180`, i.e. `Titanic`.

**Note**: Do not write a statement, and simply writing `"Titanic"` is of course not OK; the value needs to be retrieved from the structure.

:::
::: exam-sample-answer

`movies["drama"][0]["name"]`

:::
::: exam-marking-guidelines

* 0 points for an answer being a statement
* 1 point for an answer that is an expression that works
    * -0.25 points for using `Â¨` instead of `"`

## Question 14 (1p)
:::: exam-question-container
::: exam-question

Implement the function `get_number`, which receives the name of a digit in English, and should return the number that digit represents (`0` for `zero`, `1` for `one`, etc.). You only need to support the digits that are shown in the table below.

| Digit name | Number |
|---|---|
| zero | 0 |
| one | 1 |
| two | 2 |
| three | 3 |
| four | 4 |

If the name of the digit the function receives is not one of the ones in the table above, return `-1`.

Sample usage:

```
get_number('two')   â†’   2
get_number('three hundred and twenty one')   â†’   -1
```

:::
::: exam-sample-answer

```python
def get_number(digit_name):
    if digit_name == "zero":
        return 0
    elif digit_name == "one":
        return 1
    elif digit_name == "two":
        return 2
    elif digit_name == "three":
        return 3
    elif digit_name == "four":
        return 4
    else:
        return -1
```

## Question 15 (2p)
:::: exam-question-container
::: exam-question

Write a program that keeps asking the user to enter an integer until the user enters `stop`. The program should then compute the average value of the integers the user entered. When running the program, it can look like this (bold text represents text entered by the user).

<div style="font-family: 'Courier New';">

Enter an integer or stop: **0**\
Enter an integer or stop: **6**\
Enter an integer or stop: **4**\
Enter an integer or stop: **10**\
Enter an integer or stop: **stop**\
The average is 5.

</div>

**Note**: The output should look precisely as in the example above (including white-spaces, but with the exception of the boldness from the input, of course).

**Note**: You can expect the user to actually enter an integer or `stop` (no error handling needed).

**Note**: You can expect the user to enter at least one integer before entering `stop`.

:::
::: exam-sample-answer

```python
integers = []

entered_text = ""

while entered_text != "stop":
    
    entered_text = input("Enter an integer or stop: ")
    
    if entered_text != "stop":
        integers.append(int(entered_text))

sum = 0

for number in integers:
    sum += number

average = sum / len(integers)

print("The average is "+str(average)+".")

    * -0.25 points for not using the first `input("Enter an integer or stop: ")`
    * -0.25 points for `sum.numbers` instead of `sum(numbers)`
    * -0.5 points for `print(input(...))`
    * -0.5 points for `counter += int(userinput)`
    * -0.5 points for printing average in each iteration

## Question 16 (2p)
:::: exam-question-container
::: exam-question

Implement the function `contains_5`, which receives a list of numbers, and returns:

* `True` if at least one of the numbers in the list is the number `5`
* `False` otherwise

Write two different implementations of the function: one using a `while` loop, and another one using a `for` loop.

Sample usage:

```
contains_5([1, 2, 7, 8]) â†’ False
contains_5([7, 5, 3])    â†’ True
contains_5([5, 5, 5])    â†’ True
contains_5([])           â†’ False
```

**Note**: You may not use the `in` nor the `not in` operators in your answer.

:::

```python
def contains_5(numbers):
    for number in numbers:
        if number == 5:
            return True
    return False

def contains_5(numbers):
    index = 0
    while index < len(numbers):
        if numbers[index] == 5:
            return True
        index += 1

## Question 17 (3p)
:::: exam-question-container
::: exam-question

Below is some data about houses owned by some humans.

```python
houses = [
   {"owner": "Alice", "name": "Alice's Palace", "number_of_rooms": 9, "number_of_windows": 20},
   {"owner": "Alice", "name": "Alice's Home",   "number_of_rooms": 3, "number_of_windows": 5},
   {"owner": "Alice", "name": "Alice's Cabin",  "number_of_rooms": 1, "number_of_windows": 4},
   {"owner": "Bob",   "name": "Bob's Home",     "number_of_rooms": 4, "number_of_windows": 16},
   {"owner": "Bob",   "name": "Bob's Cabin",    "number_of_rooms": 1, "number_of_windows": 1}
]
```

It's cold in the winter, and it costs money to heat the houses. To heat a single house costs:

* 100 SEK each month...
* ...+ 10 SEK each month for each room in the house...
* ...+ 50 SEK each month for each window in the house

Write code that computes and prints the name of the human that must pay the highest heating cost per month for all the houses that human owns combined.

**Note**: Your code should still work as expected if one adds/removes houses to/from the list. `Alice` and `Bob` are not the only ones who can own a house.



:::
::: exam-sample-answer

```python
heat_base_cost_per_house = 100
heat_cost_per_room = 10
heat_cost_per_window = 50

## Question 18 (2p)
:::: exam-question-container
::: exam-question

The class `Clock` represents a time consisting of an hour unit and a minute unit. The hour unit is always between `0` and `23`, and the minute unit is always between `0` and `59`. 

The class has the following constructor/methods:

| Constructor/Method | Description |
|---|---|
| `Clock(hour, minute)` | Creates a new clock representing the time at the given `hour` and `minute` (both integers) |
| `add_one_minute()` | Adds one minute to the time in the clock. If the minute part becomes `60`, it should be set to `0`, and the hour part should be increased by one. If the hour part becomes `24`, it should be set to `0`, and `True` should be returned. `False` should be returned in all other cases |
| `get_time_as_string()` | Returns the current time in the `HH:MM` format, e.g. `03:08`. Note that the hour and minute parts in the string always consists of 2 digits |

Write a program making use of the class. In the program, you should first ask the user to enter the start time of the clock as two integers, and then continue to ask the user if she wants to add one minute to the time in the clock until she doesn't want to do that anymore. And if the clock becomes `00:00` after having added a minute to it, print a special text to the user. For the details, see the sample usage below.

Sample usage:

<div style="font-family: monospace; padding-left: 2em;">

Enter start hour: **23**\
Enter start minute: **57**\
Do you want to add one more minute? (y/n): **y**\
Current time is 23:58.\
Do you want to add one more minute? (y/n): **y**\
Current time is 23:59.\
Do you want to add one more minute? (y/n): **y**\
Starting a new day.\
Do you want to add one more minute? (y/n): **y**\
Current time is 00:01.\
Do you want to add one more minute? (y/n): **y**\
Current time is 00:02.\
Do you want to add one more minute? (y/n): **n**\
The final time is 00:02.

</div>

**Note**: The output should look precisely as in the example above (including white-spaces, but with the exception of the boldness from the input, of course).

**Note**: No error handling is needed; you can expect the user to always enter two integers in the beginning, and then `y` or `n`.

:::
::: exam-sample-answer

```python
hour = int(input("Enter start hour: "))
minute = int(input("Enter start minute: "))

clock = Clock(hour, minute)

should_continue_to_ask = True

while should_continue_to_ask:
    
    add_one_minute_answer = input("Do you want to add one more minute? (y/n): ")
    
    if add_one_minute_answer == "y":
        
        clock_changed_day = clock.add_one_minute()
        
        if clock_changed_day:
            print("Starting a new day.")
        else:
            print("Current time is "+clock.get_time_as_string()+".")

* 2 points for an answer that largely works
* Point reduction for errors:
    * -0.25 points for using `clock` instead of `Clock` to create new instance
    * -0.25 points for storing the `Clock` instance in a variable named `Clock` (as the class!)
    * -0.25 points for `clock.get_time_as_string().split(":")[0] == "00" and clock.get_time_as_string().split(":")[1] == "00"` instead of using return value from `add_one_minute()`
    * -0.25 points for using `true` instead of `True`
    * -0.25 points for using `str()` to convert a string into a string (not needed)
    * -0.25 points for output too different from example
    * -0.5 points for not using parentheses after method to call it
    * -0.5 points for using the wrong condition in the loop
    * -0.5 points for not handling the special "new day" case correct (e.g. ignoring it, or also printing `00:00`, or calling `add_one_minute()` twice in each iteration)
    * -0.5 points for never printing the new time in each iteration
    * -1 point for not creating a `clock` variable

## Question 19 (2p)
:::: exam-question-container
::: exam-question

The class `Clock` represents a time consisting of an hour unit and a minute unit. The hour unit is always between `0` and `23`, and the minute unit is always between `0` and `59`. 

The class has the following constructor/methods:

| Constructor/Method | Description |
|---|---|
| `Clock(hour, minute)` | Creates a new clock representing the time at the given `hour` and `minute` (both integers) |
| `add_one_minute()` | Adds one minute to the time in the clock. If the minute part becomes `60`, it should be set to `0`, and the hour part should be increased by one. If the hour part becomes `24`, it should be set to `0`, and `True` should be returned. `False` should be returned in all other cases |
| `get_time_as_string()` | Returns the current time in the `HH:MM` format, e.g. `03:08`. Note that the hour and minute parts in the string always consists of 2 digits |

Implement the `Clock` class per the description above.

```python
class Clock:
    
    def __init__(self, hour, minute):
        self.hour = hour
        self.minute = minute
    
    def add_one_minute(self):
        
        self.minute = self.minute + 1
        
        if self.minute == 60:
            
            self.minute = 0
            self.hour = self.hour + 1
            
            if self.hour == 24:
                self.hour = 0
                return True
        
        return False
    
    def get_time_as_string(self):
        
        if self.hour < 10:
            hh = "0"+str(self.hour)
        else:
            hh = str(self.hour)
        
        if self.minute < 10:
            mm = "0"+str(self.minute)
        else:
            mm = str(self.minute)
        
        return hh+":"+mm
```

* 0 points to answers not using the `self` parameter at all, or using class variables instead of instance variables
* 0.5 points for having the constructor correct
* 0.75 points for having `add_one_minute()` largely correct
* 0.75 points for having `get_time_as_string()` largely correct
* Point reductions for small mistakes:
    * -0.25 points for each missing `self` parameter
    * -0.25 points for `len(self.hour) < 2`, but otherwise logically correct
    * -0.25 points for using `elif` to see if hour/minute needs an extra `0` at the start (both can need it!)
    * -0.25 points for printing time in `get_time_as_string()` instead of returning it
    * -0.25 points for having parameters to the class
    * -0.5 points for not creating the `hh:mm` string correct
    * -0.5 points for creating extra variables not used
    * -0.5 points for not setting minute/hour to 0 when needed in `add_one_minute()`
