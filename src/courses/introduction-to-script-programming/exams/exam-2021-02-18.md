## Question 1
::: warning Question
Place the following lines of code in such order they can be executed (read underscores as white-spaces/indentation (Inspera doesn't allow the text to begin with white-spaces)).

* `___return entered_number + number`
* `def add_number(number):`
* `sum = add_number(5)`
* `___entered_number = int(entered_text)`
* `print("The sum is "+str(sum)+".")`
* `___entered_text = input("Enter number to add: ")`
:::




## Question 2
::: warning Question
How many statements and expressions does the following code contain?

```python
times_to_add_three = 10
the_sum = 0
while 0 < times_to_add_three:
   the_sum = the_sum + 3
   times_to_add_three = times_to_add_three - 1
```
:::




## Question 3
::: warning Question
What type of error does the code below contain? Syntax error, Logical error, Runtime error or no error at all? The purpose of the function is to compute the average value of the two numbers it receives (e.g. `average(4, 6)` → `5`).

```python
def average(number1, number2):
    return (number1 + number 2) / 2
```

:::




## Question 4
::: warning Question
What values will be stored in the variables `i` and `x` after the following code has been executed?

```python
students = ["Alice", "Bob", "Claire", "David"]
i = 0
x = 0
while i < len(students):
    x = x + len(students[i])
    i = i + 1
```
:::




## Question 5
::: warning Question
What is what in the code below?

```python
def multiply(numbers):
    return numbers[0] * numbers[1]
product = multiply([6, 2])
```

Pair each code piece with its corresponding name.

Code pieces:

* `numbers[1]`
* `numbers`
* `[2, 6]`
* `product`

Names:

* Argument
* Expression
* Variable
* Parameter

**Note:** Some code pieces may match multiple names, but there is only one way to get all 4 pairs right.
:::




## Question 6
::: warning Question
Which one of the following statements is a bad suggestion on how to represent data?

* To represent a room with a width and a height, one can use a list containing two numbers, e.g. `room = [10, 15]`.
* To represent a book with a title, one can use a dictionary with a string, e.g. `book = {"title": "There and back again"}`.
* To represent a planet with a name, one can use a string, e.g. `planet_name = "Tellus"`.
* To represent the number of books in a library, one can use an integer, e.g. `number_of_books = 120000`.
* To represent the books in a library, one can use a list containing dictionaries, e.g:
    ```python
    books = [
        {"title": "The Killer", "number_of_pages": 123},
        {"title": "Not Again", "number_of_pages": 253}
    ]
    ```
:::




## Question 7
::: warning Question
The following expression:

```python
range(3, 9, 3)
```

Creates a range containing some integers. What is the sum of the integers in that range?
:::




## Question 8
::: warning Question
Below is a program that should:

1. Ask the user to enter her name.
2. Ask the user to enter a positive integer.
3. Print the user's name as many times as the number she entered.

```python
name = input("Enter your name: ")
times_to_print = input("Enter a positive integer: ")
for i in range(times_to_print):
   print(name[i])
```

When Claire runs the program, it does not work as intended. Explain why the program doesn't work they way it should, and suggest a solution to make it work (no need to write any Python code, describing the changes using words is enough, but be detailed).
:::




## Question 9
::: warning Question
What integers should be assigned to the variables `a` and `b` to slice out the values `"r"`, `"s"` and `"t"` in the code below?

```python
my_list = ["r", "s", "t", "u", "v"]
a = ?
b = ?
my_new_list = my_list[a:b]
# my_new_list should now be ["r", "s", "t"]
```
:::





## Question 10
::: warning Question
Write the following code:

```python
my_list = [c+c for c in "abcdef"]
```

Using a for loop (and the other things you need) instead of a list comprehension expression. Your own code should have the exact same meaning as the code above.
:::





## Question 11
::: warning Question
Write the following code:

```python
list = [-x for x in get_numbers() if is_positive(x)]
```

Using a for loop (and the other things you need) instead of a list comprehension expression. Your own code should have the exact same meaning as the code above.
:::





## Question 12
::: warning Question
Here is a quite complex structure with information about the population in different areas:

```python
populations = {
    "countries": [
        {"name": "Sweden", "population": 9903000},
        {"name": "Finland", "population": 5495000},
        {"name": "Norway", "population": 5233000}
    ],
    "cities": [
        {"name": "Stockholm", "population": 789024},
        {"name": "Jönköping", "population": 122952}
    ]
}
```

Given this structure, write **an expression** that evaluates to the population of the country with the name `Stockholm`, i.e. `789024`.

**Note**: Do not write a statement, and simply writing `789024` is of course not OK; the value needs to be retrieved from the structure.
:::






## Question 13
::: warning Question
Suggest how the following data in Python:

```python
team = {"name": "Arsenal", "city": "London"}
```

Can be written in XML code instead.
:::





## Question 14
::: warning Question
Suggest how the following data in Python:

```python
countries = [
   {"name": "Arsenal", "city": "London"},
   {"name": "Tottenham", "city": "London"},
   {"name": "Elfsborg", "city": "Borås"}
]
```

Can be written in CSV format. Do not write any extra characters not needed, but use as few characters as possible.
:::





## Question 15
::: warning Question
The following code crashes when it's executed.

```python
def read_name():
   name = input("Enter name: ")
def print_name():
   print("Your name is "+name)
read_name()
print_name()
```

Explain why it crashes, and suggest what changes that needs to be made to make it work. Your solution should contain one function for reading the name from the user and one to print the name the user entered.
:::




## Question 16
::: warning Question
What will be stored in the variable `sum` after the following code has been executed?

```python
def a(number):
    number = number + 1
def b(list):
    for number in list:
        number = number + 3
def c(list):
    for i in range(len(list)):
        list[i] = list[i] + 5
my_list = [1, 1]
c(my_list)
b(my_list)
b(my_list)
c(my_list)
sum = my_list[0] + my_list[1]
```
:::





## Question 17
::: warning Question

Implement the function `get_abbreviation`, which receives a string and should return the abbreviation of that string. Your function should support the following abbreviations:

| String | Abbreviation |
|---|---|
| et cetera | etc. |
| with | w/ |
| you | u |

If the string is none of the strings found in the table above, return the string itself.

Sample usage:

```
get_abbreviation("with")   →   "w/"
get_abbreviation("as soon as possible")   →   "as soon as possible"
```
:::





## Question 18
::: warning Question
Write a program that keeps asking the user to enter an integer until the user enters `stop`. The program should then print the sum of the lowest and highest integer the user entered. When running the program, it can look like this (bold text represents text entered by the user).

Enter an integer or stop: **2**\
Enter an integer or stop: **6**\
Enter an integer or stop: **4**\
Enter an integer or stop: **stop**\
The sum of the lowest and highest integer is 8.

**Note**: The output should look precisely as in the example above (including white-spaces, but with the exception of the boldness from the input, of course).

**Note**: You can expect the user to actually enter a number or stop (no error handling needed).

**Note**: You can expect the user to enter at least two numbers.
:::





## Question 19
::: warning Question
Implement the function `is_sum_at_least_100`, which receives a list of numbers, and returns:

* `true` if the sum of the numbers is equal to or greater than 100.
* `false` otherwise.

Write two different implementations of the function: one using (at least) one while loop, and another one using (at least) one for loop.

Sample usage:

```
is_sum_at_least_100([50, 50, 20])   →  true
is_sum_at_least_100([50, 50, -20])  →  false
is_sum_at_least_100([])             →  false
```
:::





## Question 20
::: warning Question
Implement the function `int_to_digits`, which receives a positive integer, and should return a list containing the digits in that integer.

Sample usage:

```
int_to_digits(123)   →  [1, 2, 3]
int_to_digits(5398)  →  [5, 3, 9, 8]
```
:::





## Question 21
::: warning Question
Given the following data about some <del>movies</del> <ins>houses</ins>:

```python
houses = [
   {"owner": "Alice", "name": "Alice's Palace", "size": 320, "number_of_rooms": 9},
   {"owner": "Alice", "name": "Alice's Home",   "size": 84,  "number_of_rooms": 3},
   {"owner": "Alice", "name": "Alice's Cabin",  "size": 30,  "number_of_rooms": 1},
   {"owner": "Bob",   "name": "Bob's Home",     "size": 94,  "number_of_rooms": 4},
   {"owner": "Bob",   "name": "Bob's Cabin",    "size": 30,  "number_of_rooms": 1}
]
```

Write code that computes and prints the name of the human that owns the most number of rooms in total.

**Note**: Your code should still work as expected if one adds/removes houses to/from the list. Alice and Bob are not the only ones who can own a house.
:::






## Question 22
::: warning Question
The class `MovieCollection` represents a collection of movies. It has the following constructor/methods:

| Constructor/Method | Description |
|---|---|
| `MovieCollection()` | Creates a new empty `MovieCollection`. |
| `add_movie(name, runtime)` | Adds the movie with the given `name` and `runtime` (length in minutes) to the collection. |
| `get_number_of_movies()` | Returns the number of movies in the collection. |
| `get_total_runtime()` | Returns the sum of the runtime of all movies in the collection. |
| `get_average_runtime()` | Returns the average runtime of the movies in the collection. |

Write a program making use of the class. In the program, you should continue to ask the user to enter the name and runtime of a movie to be added to the `MovieCollection` until the user don't want to add any more. Then you should display the average runtime of the movies in the collection on the screen.

Sample usage:

<div style="font-family: monospace; padding-left: 2em;">

Enter one more movie? **Yes**\
Enter movie name: **Catch me if you can**\
Enter movie runtime: **115**\
Enter one more movie? **Yes**\
Enter movie name: **See you later**\
Enter movie runtime: **75**\
Enter one more movie? **No**\
Average runtime is 95.

</div>

:::





## Question 23
::: warning Question
The class `MovieCollection` represents a collection of movies. It has the following constructor/methods:

| Constructor/Method | Description |
|---|---|
| `MovieCollection()` | Creates a new empty `MovieCollection`. |
| `add_movie(name, runtime)` | Adds the movie with the given `name` and `runtime` (length in minutes) to the collection. |
| `get_number_of_movies()` | Returns the number of movies in the collection. |
| `get_total_runtime()` | Returns the sum of the runtime of all movies in the collection. |
| `get_average_runtime()` | Returns the average runtime of the movies in the collection. |

Implement the `MovieCollection` class per the description above.
