# Exam 2023-02-15
Here you find the questions, sample answers and marking guidelines for the exam 2023-02-15.

## Information
Start by reading through all questions. Peter will not visit the exam. If you find any question unclear, ask one of the exam administrators (*tentavakt* in Swedish) to call Peter, and he will clarify the question over the phone.

Max score is 25 points.

* For grade 3, 40% of max score (10 points) is required
* For grade 4, 60% of max score (15 points) is required
* For grade 5, 80% of max score (20 points) is required

During the test, you are only allowed to use:

* The computer you sit at to only answer the questions on this exam (you may not run any other program)
* A dictionary to translate to/from English from/to your native language
* Pen and paper to sketch/write notes with (does not need to be submitted)

Write your answers in either English or Swedish. If you write your answers in Swedish, make sure to not introduce any translation confusement. **Write proper sentences (spelling, upper/lower case characters, punctuation, etc.).** Answers that do not do this good enough/are vague/are ununderstandable cannot receive full score on the questions.

Answers that are more or less copies of sample answers given to you or copies of text found somewhere else will be rewarded 0 points. Use your own words to answer the questions (does not apply to questions where you write code).

Good luck!


## Question 1 (1p)
:::: exam-question-container
::: exam-question

Place the following lines of code in such order they can be executed (read underscores (`____`) as white-spaces/indentation (Inspera doesn't allow the text to begin with white-spaces ðŸ˜ž)).

* `____color = "#"+number+number+number`
* `def get_color():`
* `number = input("Enter number: ")`
* `print(color+" is a nice color.")`
* `color = get_color()`
* `____return color`

You will get:

* 1 point for all in correct order

## Question 6 (1p)
:::: exam-question-container
::: exam-question

Bart is assigned the task to implement a program that prints this:

<div style="font-family: monospace; padding-left: 2em;">

B\
a\
a\
r\
r\
r\
t\
t\
t\
t

</div>

Bart writes the following code:

```python
name = "Bart"

for i in range(len(name) + 1):
    
    letter = name[i]
    
    for j in range(i):
        print(letter)
```

Bart's solution does not work as it should. Explain what errors Bart has done, and suggest how to fix them.

:::
::: exam-sample-answer

One problem is that he has `range(len(name) + 1)`. Because of that, the program will try to print the letter with index `4`, which doesn't exist. It should just be `range(len(name))`

Another problem is that the inner for loop iterates over `range(i)`. Here, he should instead use `range(i + 1)`, so for the first letter (`i = 0`), it will iterate `1` time, etc.

## Question 7 (1p)
:::: exam-question-container
::: exam-question

The following expression:

```python
range(2, 2, 2)
```

Creates a range. What is the sum of the integers in that range?

:::
::: exam-sample-answer

The sum is: `0`

:::

## Question 8 (1p)
:::: exam-question-container
::: exam-question

What non-negative integers should be assigned to the variables `x` and `y` to slice out the values `"d"` and `"e"` in the code below?

```python
my_list = ["a", "b", "c", "d", "e"]
x = ?
y = ?
my_new_list = my_list[x:y]
# my_new_list should now be ["d", "e"]
```

You will get:

* 1 point for both correct

:::
::: exam-sample-answer

`x`: `3`

`y`: `5`

:::
::: exam-marking-guidelines

* 1 point for both correct

## Question 9 (1p)
:::: exam-question-container
::: exam-question

Write the following code:

```python
my_list = [x*2 for x in numbers() if x % 2 == 0]
```

As statements using a loop instead. Your own code should have the exact same meaning as the code above.

:::
::: exam-sample-answer

```python
my_list = []
for x in numbers():
    if x % 2 == 0:
        my_list.append(x)
```

:::
::: exam-marking-guidelines

* 1 point for an answer that is largely correct
* Point reduction for errors:
    * -0.1 points for missing `:`
    * -0.1 points for spelling variable wrong
    * -0.25 points for indentation error

:::

## Question 10 (1p)
:::: exam-question-container
::: exam-question

Here is a quite complex structure with information about different movies:

```python
movies = {
    "action": [
        {"name": "GoldenEye", "runtime": 110},
        {"name": "Mission Impossible", "runtime": 115},
        {"name": "Pearl Harbor", "runtime": 160}
    ],
    "drama": [
        {"name": "Titanic", "runtime": 180},
        {"name": "Love Actually", "runtime": 120}
    ]
}
```

Given this very structure, write an **expression** that evaluates to the runtime of the movie with the name `Mission Impossible`, i.e. `115`.

**Note**: Do not write a statement, and simply writing `115` is of course not OK; the value needs to be retrieved from the structure.

:::
::: exam-sample-answer

`movies["action"][1]["runtime"]`

:::
::: exam-marking-guidelines

* 0 points for an answer being a statement
* 1 point for an answer that is an expression that works
    * -0.5 points for not having quotes around `action` or `runtime`

## Question 11 (1p)
:::: exam-question-container
::: exam-question

Suggest how the data in the XML code below:

```xml
<games>
    <game>
        <title>Super Mario Bros.</title>
        <year>1985</year>
    </game>
    <game>
        <title>The Legend of Zelda: A Link to the Past</title>
        <year>1991</year>
    </game>
</games>
```

Can be represented in Python (i.e. create a Python variable with a descriptive name that contains the same data as the XML code above does).

**Note**: This question is not about writing Python code that reads data from the XML code; you should just write Python code that creates a variable that contains the same (hard coded) data that is currently shown in the XML code above.

:::
::: exam-sample-answer

```python
games = [{
    "title": "Super Mario Bros.",
    "year": 1985
}, {
    "title": "The Legend of Zelda: A Link to the Past",
    "year": 1991
}]
```

:::
::: exam-marking-guidelines

* 1 point for an answer that largely works
* Point reduction for errors:
    * -0.25 points for bad variable name (like `game` instead of `games`)
    * -0.25 points for a dict (instead of list) that contains dict games
    * -0.25 points for representing year as string


:::

## Question 12 (1p)
:::: exam-question-container
::: exam-question

Suggest how the data in the XML code below:

```xml
<games>
    <game>

        <title>The Legend of Zelda: A Link to the Past</title>
        <year>1991</year>
    </game>
</game>
```

Can be expressed in CSV format.

**Note**: This question is not about writing Python code, but CSV code.

**Note**: Do not write any extra characters not needed.

:::
::: exam-sample-answer

```csv
Super Mario Bros.,1985
The Legend of Zelda: A Link to the Past,1991

:::: exam-question-container
::: exam-question

What will be stored in the variable `sum` after the following code has been executed?

```python
def a(number):
    number = number + 2

def b(list):
    for number in list:
        number = number + 1

def c(list):
    for i in range(len(list)):
        list[i] = list[i] + 3

my_list = [0, 1]

a(my_list[0])

## Question 14 (1p)
:::: exam-question-container
::: exam-question

Implement the function `get_number_of_digits()`, which receives an integer, and should return the number digits that integer contains. The integer the function receives will always be between `1` and `999`.

Sample usage:

```
get_number_of_digits(8)   â†’   1
get_number_of_digits(9)   â†’   1
get_number_of_digits(23)   â†’   2
get_number_of_digits(471)   â†’   3
get_number_of_digits(892)   â†’   3
```

:::
::: exam-sample-answer

```python
def get_number_of_digits(integer):
    if integer < 10:
        return 1
    elif integer < 100:
        return 2
    else:
        return 3
```

    * -0.1 points for writing `=<` instead of `<=`
    * -0.1 points for each bad variable name
    * -1 point for using a loop

OR:

* 0.25 points for using `len` to compute the number of digits without converting the number to a string first

:::

## Question 15 (2p)
:::: exam-question-container
::: exam-question

Write a program that keeps asking the user to enter an integer until the user enters `stop`. The program should count how many odd respective even (the opposite to odd) integers the user entered, and then show that to the user. To check if `an_integer` is odd, you can use the expression `an_integer % 2 == 1`. When running the program, it can look like this (bold text represents text entered by the user).

<div style="font-family: 'Courier New';">

Enter an integer or stop: **8**\
Enter an integer or stop: **3**\
Enter an integer or stop: **4**\
Enter an integer or stop: **9**\
Enter an integer or stop: **5**\
Enter an integer or stop: **stop**\
You entered 3 odd integers and 2 even integers.

</div>

**Note**: The output should look precisely as in the example above (including white-spaces, but with the exception of the boldness from the input, of course).

**Note**: You can expect the user to actually enter an integer or `stop` (no error handling needed).

:::
::: exam-sample-answer

```python
number_of_odd_integers = 0
number_of_even_integers = 0

entered_text = ""

while entered_text != "stop":
    
    entered_text = input("Enter an integer or stop: ")
    
    if entered_text != "stop":
        
        entered_integer = int(entered_text)
        
        if entered_integer % 2 == 1:
            number_of_odd_integers += 1
        else:
            number_of_even_integers += 1

print("You entered "+str(number_of_odd_integers)+" odd integers and "+str(number_of_even_integers)+" even integers.")

## Question 16 (2p)
:::: exam-question-container
::: exam-question

Implement the function `are_all_equal`, which receives a list of numbers, and returns:

* `True` if all numbers in the list are equal
* `False` otherwise

Write two different implementations of the function: one using a `while` loop, and another one using a `for` loop.

Sample usage:

```
are_all_equal([1, 1, 1, 1]) â†’ True
are_all_equal([5, 5, 5])    â†’ True
are_all_equal([1, 2, 3])    â†’ False
are_all_equal([7, 7, 8])    â†’ False
are_all_equal([])           â†’ True
```

**Note**: If the list is empty, return `True`.

:::
::: exam-sample-answer

```python
def are_all_equal(numbers):
    for number in numbers:
        if number != numbers[0]:
            return False

## Question 17 (3p)
:::: exam-question-container
::: exam-question

Below is some data about houses owned by some humans.

```python
houses = [
   {"owner": "Alice", "name": "Alice's Palace", "number_of_rooms": 9, "number_of_windows": 20},
   {"owner": "Alice", "name": "Alice's Home",   "number_of_rooms": 3, "number_of_windows": 5},
   {"owner": "Alice", "name": "Alice's Cabin",  "number_of_rooms": 1, "number_of_windows": 4},
   {"owner": "Bob",   "name": "Bob's Home",     "number_of_rooms": 4, "number_of_windows": 16},
   {"owner": "Bob",   "name": "Bob's Cabin",    "number_of_rooms": 1, "number_of_windows": 1}
]
```

It's cold in the winter, and it costs money to heat the houses. To heat a single house costs:

* 100 SEK each month...
* ...+ 10 SEK each month for each room in the house...
* ...+ 50 SEK each month for each window in the house

Write code that first computes which house that has the highest heating cost. Then compute how big heating cost the owner of that house has for all the houses that human owns together, and show that to the user.

**Note**: Your code should still work as expected if one adds/removes houses to/from the list. `Alice` and `Bob` are not the only ones who can own a house.



:::
::: exam-sample-answer

```python
heat_base_cost_per_house = 100
heat_cost_per_room = 10

        heat_base_cost_per_house +
        heat_cost_per_room * house["number_of_rooms"] +

# Find the total cost that owner pays.
total_cost = 0

for house in houses:
    if highest_heating_cost_house["owner"] == house["owner"]:
        total_cost += get_heating_cost(house)

# Show the result.

## Question 18 (2p)
:::: exam-question-container
::: exam-question

The class `Population` represents a population of humans.

The class has the following constructor/methods:

| Constructor/Method | Description |
|---|---|
| `Population()` | Creates a new empty population |
| `add_human(name, is_female)` | Adds one human to the population with the given `name` (string) and the given `is_female` (`True` for females, `False` for males) |
| `get_percentage_females()` | Returns the percentage (a number between `0` and `100`) of the population that are females |
| `get_percentage_males()` | Returns the percentage (a number between `0` and `100`) of the population that are males |

Write a program making use of the class. In the program, you should continue to ask the user to enter the name, sex and age of a human until the user doesn't want to add any more. Then the program should print how many percentages of the population that are females respective males.

Sample usage:

<div style="font-family: monospace; padding-left: 2em;">

Enter one more human? (yes/no): **yes**\
Enter name: **Alice**\
Enter sex (female/male): **female**\
Enter one more human? (yes/no): **yes**\
Enter name: **Bob**\
Enter sex (female/male): **male**\
Enter one more human? (yes/no): **yes**\
Enter name: **Claire**\
Enter sex (female/male): **female**\
Enter one more human? (yes/no): **yes**\
Enter name: **Denise**\
Enter sex (female/male): **female**\
Enter one more human? (yes/no): **no**\
75% of the population are females.\
25% of the population are males.

</div>

**Note**: The output should look precisely as in the example above (including white-spaces, but with the exception of the boldness from the input, of course). It is OK if the percentage numbers on the last two lines show decimal numbers.

**Note**: No error handling is needed; you can expect the user to always enter valid values.
