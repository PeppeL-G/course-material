# Exam 2022-08-17
Here you find the questions, sample answers and marking guidelines for the exam 2022-08-17.

## Information
Start by reading through all questions. Max score is 30 points.

* For grade 3, 40% of max score (12 points) is required
* For grade 4, 60% of max score (18 points) is required
* For grade 5, 80% of max score (24 points) is required

During the test, you are only allowed to use:

* The computer you sit at to only answer the questions on this exam (you may not run any other program)
* A dictionary to translate to/from English from/to your native language
* Pen and paper to sketch things (does not need to be submitted)

Write your answers in either English or Swedish. If you write your answers in Swedish, make sure to not introduce any translation confusement. **Write proper sentences (spelling, upper/lower case characters, punctuation, etc.).** Answers that do not do this good enough/are vague/are ununderstandable cannot receive full score on the questions.

Answers that are more or less copies of sample answers given to you or copies of text found somewhere else will be rewarded 0 points. Use your own words to answer the questions.

Good luck!


## Question 1 (1p)
:::: exam-question-container
::: exam-question

Place the following lines of code in such order they can be executed (read underscores as white-spaces/indentation (Inspera doesn't allow the text to begin with white-spaces ðŸ˜ž)).

* `def get_age(born_year):`
* `___current_year = 2022`
* `___age = current_year - born_year`
* `___return age`
* `entered_age = get_age(int(input("Enter born year: ")))`
* `if entered_age < 0:`
* `___print("You can't be "+str(entered_age)+".")`

You will get:

## Question 6 (1p)
:::: exam-question-container
::: exam-question

Which one of the following statements is a bad suggestion on how to represent data?

* To represent the name of flower, one can use a string, e.g. `flower_name = "Lily"`
* To represent multiple flower names, one can use a list with strings, e.g. `flower_names = ["Lily", "Rose"]`
* To represent the color of a flower, one can use a string, e.g. `flower_color = "white"`
* To represent the length of a flower (in centimeters), one can use an integer, e.g. `flower_length = 10`
* To represent the name of a flower with a specific color, one can use a list containing two strings, e.g. `flower = ["Lily", "white"]`
* All other statements are good ways of representing data

## Question 8 (1p)
:::: exam-question-container
::: exam-question

The two code pieces below, although written differently, have the same functionality (i.e. it doesn't matter which one you choose, the outcome will be the same).

```python
a = 1 + 2
```
```python
a = 2 + 1
```

Below are two other code pieces.

**Code Piece 1**
```python
if check_condition_a():
    do_thing_a()
elif check_condition_b():
    do_thing_b()
```

**Code Piece 2**
```python
if check_condition_b():
    do_thing_b()
elif check_condition_a():
    do_thing_a()
```

Do `Code Piece 1` and `Code Piece 2` above have the same functionality? I.e., does it not matter which one of them you use, or do they somehow differ? Justify your answer.

:::
::: exam-sample-answer

If both `check_condition_a()` and `check_condition_b()` would be `True`, then Code Piece 1 would only call `do_thing_a()`, and Code Piece 2 would only call `do_thing_b()`, so they would not function the same

:::

## Question 9 (1p)
:::: exam-question-container
::: exam-question

What integers should be assigned to the variables `x` and `y` to slice out the values `"a"`, `"b"` and `"c"` in the code below?

```python
my_list = ["a", "b", "c", "d", "e"]
x = ?
y = ?
my_new_list = my_list[x:y]
# my_new_list should now be ["a", "b", "c"]
```

You will get:

* 1 point for both correct

:::
::: exam-sample-answer

`x`: `0`

`y`: `3`

## Question 10 (1p)
:::: exam-question-container
::: exam-question

Write the following code:

```python
my_list = [-i for i in range(12)]
```

As code making use of a loop instead of a list comprehension expression. Your own code should have the exact same meaning as the code above.

:::
::: exam-sample-answer

```python
my_list = []
for i in range(12):
    my_list.append(-i)
```

:::
::: exam-marking-guidelines

* 1 point for an answer that is largely correct
* Point reduction for errors:
    * -0.1 points for spelling variable name wrong
    * -0.5 points for calling `append()` something else
    * -0.5 points for using assignment when appending
    * -0.75 points for using assignment when appending and not using `append()` at all

## Question 11 (1p)
:::: exam-question-container
::: exam-question

Write the following code:

```python
my_list = ["letter "+c for c in get_alphabet_characters() if c+c != "cc"]
```

As code making use of a loop instead of a list comprehension expression. Your own code should have the exact same meaning as the code above.

:::
::: exam-sample-answer

```python
my_list = []
for c in get_alphabet_characters():
    if c+c != "cc":
        my_list.append("letter "+c)
```

:::
::: exam-marking-guidelines

## Question 12 (1p)
:::: exam-question-container
::: exam-question

Here is a quite complex structure with information about different movies:

```python
movies = {
    "action": [
        {"name": "GoldenEye", "runtime": 110},
        {"name": "Mission Impossible", "runtime": 115},
        {"name": "Pearl Harbor", "runtime": 160}
    ],
    "drama": [
        {"name": "Titanic", "runtime": 180},
        {"name": "Love Actually", "runtime": 120}
    ]
}
```

Given this structure, write an **expression** that evaluates to the runtime of the movie with the name `GoldenEye`, i.e. `110`.

**Note**: Do not write a statement, and simply writing `110` is of course not OK; the value needs to be retrieved from the structure.

:::
::: exam-sample-answer

`movies["action"][0]["runtime"]`

```python
cats = [{
    "name": "Catty",
    "age": 12,
}, {
    "name": "Kitty",
    "age": 3
}]
```

Can be expressed in XML format.

:::
::: exam-sample-answer

```xml
<cats>
    <cat>
        <name>Catty</name>
        <age>12</age>
    </cat>
    <cat>

## Question 14 (1p)
:::: exam-question-container
::: exam-question

Suggest how the following data in Python:

```python
cats = [{
    "name": "Catty",
    "age": 12,
}, {
    "name": "Kitty",
    "age": 3
}]
```

Can be expressed in CSV format. Do not write any extra characters not needed, but use as few characters as possible.

:::
::: exam-sample-answer

```csv
Catty,12
Kitty,3
```

:::
::: exam-marking-guidelines

* 1 point for an answer that largely works
* Point reduction for errors:
    * -0.5 points for writing a space after the delimiter
    * -0.5 points for surrounding the value with a quote character when not needed
    * -0.5 points for having a blank line between entries

## Question 15 (1p)
:::: exam-question-container
::: exam-question

What's the problem in the code below?

```python
def get_sum(x, y):
    print(x + y)

def get_product(x, y):
    print(x * y)

print("2 + (3 * 4) = " + str(get_sum(2, get_product(3, 4))))
```

:::
::: exam-sample-answer

The problem is that the functions `get_sum()` and `get_product()` prints their results, but the last line of code above instead use them as if they returned their results instead.

:::
::: exam-marking-guidelines

* 1 point for correct explanation of problem/error

## Question 16 (1p)
:::: exam-question-container
::: exam-question

What will be stored in the variable `sum` after the following code has been executed?

```python
def a(number):
    number = number + 1

def b(list):
    for number in list:
        number = number + 2

def c(list):
    for i in range(len(list)):
        list[i] = list[i] + 3

my_list = [0, 0]

a(my_list[0])
c(my_list)

b(my_list)

sum = my_list[0] + my_list[1]
```

`sum`: ...

:::

## Question 17 (2p)
:::: exam-question-container
::: exam-question

Implement the function `get_remaining_minutes_of_day()`, which receives a string as argument in the format `HH:MM`, representing a time of day expressed in 24 hour format (we don't care about seconds). The function should then compute and return the number of minutes that remains of the day from that time.

Sample usage:

```
get_remaining_minutes_of_day("23:59")   â†’   1
get_remaining_minutes_of_day("23:00")   â†’   60
get_remaining_minutes_of_day("22:00")   â†’   120
get_remaining_minutes_of_day("21:30")   â†’   150
get_remaining_minutes_of_day("09:45")   â†’   855
get_remaining_minutes_of_day("00:00")   â†’   1440
```

**Note**: The time `24:00` does not exist (that would be `00:00` the next day).

:::
::: exam-sample-answer

```python
def get_remaining_minutes_of_day(time):
    hour = int(time[0:2])
    minute = int(time[3:5])
    remaining_hours = 23 - hour
    remaining_minutes_of_last_hour = 60 - minute
    return remaining_hours*60 + remaining_minutes_of_last_hour
```

## Question 18 (1p)
:::: exam-question-container
::: exam-question

Write a program that keeps asking the user to enter a number until the sum of the entered numbers is greater than `100`. It should then print the sum of the entered numbers.

<div style="font-family: 'Courier New';">

Enter a number: **10**\
Enter a number: **50**\
Enter a number: **20**\
Enter a number: **40**\
The sum of the entered numbers is 120.

</div>

**Note**: The output should have the very same format as in the example above (including white-spaces, but with the exception of the boldness of the input, of course). You can expect the user to always enter numbers (no error handling needed).

:::
::: exam-sample-answer

```python
sum = 0

while sum < 100:
    
    entered_number = int(input("Enter a number: "))
    
    sum += entered_number

print("The sum of the entered numbers is "+str(sum)+".")
```

## Question 19 (2p)
:::: exam-question-container
::: exam-question

Implement the function `are_all_integers_even()`, which receives a list of integers, and returns:

* `True` if all of the integers are even
* `False` otherwise

Write two different implementations of the function: one using a `while` loop, and another one using a `for` loop.

To check if `an_integer` is even, you can use the expression `an_integer % 2 == 0`.

Sample usage:

```
are_all_integers_even([10, 5])  â†’  False
are_all_integers_even([2, 4, 6])  â†’  True
are_all_integers_even([])  â†’  True
```

:::
::: exam-sample-answer

```python
def are_all_integers_even(integers):
    for integer in integers:
        if integer % 2 != 0:
            return False
    return True

def are_all_integers_even(integers):
    index = 0
    while index < len(integers):
        integer = integers[index]
        if integer % 2 != 0:
            return False
        index += 1
    return False
```

:::

* 1 point for the function with the `for` loop largely working
* 1 point for the function with the `while` loop largely working
* Point reduction for small mistakes or doing weird things:
    * -0.1 points for each bad name
    * -0.2 points for iterating over index instead of values in the `for` loop
    * -0.25 points for each extra global variable (not needed)
    * -0.5 points for having a range as condition in `while`
    * -0.75 points for always returning `True`/`False` in first iteration

## Question 20 (2p)
:::: exam-question-container
::: exam-question

Implement the function `get_name_lengths()`, which receives a list with names, and returns a new list containing the lengths of each name.

Sample usage:

```
get_name_lengths(["Alice", "Bob", "Lisa"])  â†’  [5, 3, 4]
get_name_lengths(["Al", "Alibaba"])  â†’  [2, 7]
```

## Question 21 (3p)
:::: exam-question-container
::: exam-question

Below is some data about houses owned by some humans.

```python
houses = [
   {"owner": "Alice", "name": "Alice's Palace", "number_of_rooms": 9, "number_of_windows": 20},
   {"owner": "Alice", "name": "Alice's Home",   "number_of_rooms": 3, "number_of_windows": 5},
   {"owner": "Alice", "name": "Alice's Cabin",  "number_of_rooms": 1, "number_of_windows": 4},
   {"owner": "Bob",   "name": "Bob's Home",     "number_of_rooms": 4, "number_of_windows": 16},
   {"owner": "Bob",   "name": "Bob's Cabin",    "number_of_rooms": 1, "number_of_windows": 1}
]
```

In a house with:

* 3 or fewer rooms, each room is 12 square meters big
* 4 or more rooms, each room is 10 square meters big

In front of each window is an element occupying 0.1 square meters of the available space each.

Write code that computes which human that have the most available space when all rooms are empty (but still containing the radiators, of course). Your code should print the name of that human.

**Note**: Your code should still work as expected if one adds/removes houses to/from the list. `Alice` and `Bob` are not the only ones who can own a house.

## Question 22 (2p)
:::: exam-question-container
::: exam-question

The class `CodeGame` represents a game where the user should guess on a code between `1000` and `9999`. The one creating a new instance of the class gets to decide which the correct code should be (represented as a string). 

The class `CodeGame` has the following constructor/methods:

| Constructor/Method | Description |
|---|---|
| `CodeGame(correct_code)` | Creates a new game with the given `correct_code` (string consisting of 4 digits). |
| `is_correct_code(guessed_code)` | Returns `True` if the string `guessed_code` is the correct code, otherwise `False`. |
| `get_hint(guessed_code)` | Returns the string `guessed_code` but with all wrong digits (compared to the correct code) replaced by `_`. |

Write a program making use of the class. In the program, the correct code should be `"5678"`. You should then ask the user to keep guessing on the correct code until the user guess the correct one. For each guess, also show which digits that are correct (see the sample below).

Sample usage:

<div style="font-family: monospace; padding-left: 2em;">

Enter guess: **1234**\
\_\_\_\_\
Enter guess: **5555**\
5\_\_\_\
Enter guess: **7777**\
\_\_7\_\
Enter guess: **5879**\
5\_7\_\
Enter guess: **5678**\
That is correct!

</div>

**Note**: The output should look precisely as in the example above (including white-spaces, but with the exception of the boldness from the input, of course).

**Note**: No error handling is needed; you can expect the user to always enter a string consisting of 4 digits.

:::

```python
game = CodeGame("5678")
