# Exam 2021-12-15
Here you find the questions, sample answers and marking guidelines for the exam 2021-12-15.

## Information
Start by reading through all questions. Max score is 30 points.

* For grade 3, 40% of max score (12 points) is required.
* For grade 4, 60% of max score (18 points) is required.
* For grade 5, 80% of max score (24 points) is required.

During the test, you are only allowed to use:

* The computer you sit at to only answer the questions on this exam (you may not run any other program).
* A dictionary to translate to/from English from/to your native language.
* Pen and paper to sketch things (does not need to be submitted).

Write your answers in either English or Swedish. If you write your answers in Swedish, make sure to not introduce any translation confusement. **Write proper sentences (spelling, upper/lower case characters, punctuation, etc.).** Answers that do not do this good enough/are vague/are ununderstandable cannot receive full score on the questions.

Answers that are more or less copies of sample answers given to you or copies of text found somewhere else will be rewarded 0 points. Use your own words to answer the questions.

Good luck!

## Question 6 (1p)
:::: exam-question-container
::: exam-question

Which one of the following statements is a bad suggestion on how to represent data?

* To represent the number of students in a class, one can use an integer, e.g. `number_of_students = 36`.
* To represent a student with a name and an age, one can use a list containing a string and an integer, e.g. `student = ["Alice", 21]`.
* To represent a student with an age, one can use a dictionary with an integer, e.g. `student = {"age": 21}`.
* To represent the age of the oldest student in a class, one can use an integer, e.g. `highest_age_in_class = 29`.
* To represent the names of many students, one can use a list with strings, e.g. `student_names = ["Alice", "Bob"]`.
* All other statements are good ways of representing data.

## Question 8 (1p)
:::: exam-question-container
::: exam-question

In a Python program, when asking the user to enter a number using the `input()` function, we very often also use another function to be able to work with the number the user enters. Explain why we often need to use another function before we start working with the number the user enters, and name one of these other functions we can use.

:::
::: exam-sample-answer

The `input()` function returns what the user has entered as a string, so even if the user enters the number `23`, we get it back as the string `"23"`. To be able to work with the number (use it in addition expressions, etc.), we need to have it as an integer or a float. We can for example use the `int()` function to convert it to an integer.

:::
::: exam-marking-guidelines

* 0.5 points for `input()` always returning string, and we need the value to be integer or float
* 0.5 points for `int()` or `float()`

:::

## Question 9 (1p)
:::: exam-question-container
::: exam-question

What integers should be assigned to the variables `x` and `y` to slice out the values `"a"` and `"b"` in the code below?

```python
my_list = ["a", "b", "c", "d", "e"]
x = ?
y = ?
my_new_list = my_list[x:y]
# my_new_list should now be ["a", "b"]
```

You will get:

* 1 point for both correct

:::
::: exam-sample-answer

`x`: `0`

`y`: `2`

## Question 10 (1p)
:::: exam-question-container
::: exam-question

Write the following code:

```python
my_list = []
for x in range(100):
    my_list.append(x*x)
```

As a list comprehension expression instead. Your own code should have the exact same meaning as the code above.

:::
::: exam-sample-answer

```python
my_list = [x*x for x in range(100)]
```

:::
::: exam-marking-guidelines

* 1 point for an answer that is largely correct
* Point reduction for errors:
    * -0.1 points for naming the `my_list` variable wrong
    * -0.5 points for missing `[` and `]`
    * -1 point for not creating the `my_list` variable

:::

## Question 11 (1p)
:::: exam-question-container
::: exam-question

Write the following code:

```python
my_list = []
for name in get_names("students"):
    if 3 < len(name):
        my_list.append(len(name) + 1)
```

As a list comprehension expression instead. Your own code should have the exact same meaning as the code above.

:::
::: exam-sample-answer

```python
my_list = [len(name) + 1 for name in get_names("students") if 3 < len(name)]

    * -1 point for placing the `if`-part at wrong location
    * -1 point for mapping to wrong value
    * -1 point for missing `[` and `]`
    * -0.25 points for naming the `my_list` variable wrong

## Question 12 (1p)
:::: exam-question-container
::: exam-question

Here is a quite complex structure with information about different movies:

```python
movies = {
    "action": [
        {"name": "GoldenEye", "runtime": 110},
        {"name": "Mission Impossible", "runtime": 115},
        {"name": "Pearl Harbor", "runtime": 160}
    ],
    "drama": [
        {"name": "Titanic", "runtime": 180},
        {"name": "Love Actually", "runtime": 120}
    ]
}
```

Given this structure, write an **expression** that evaluates to the runtime of the movie with the name `Mission Impossible`, i.e. `115`.

**Note**: Do not write a statement, and simply writing `115` is of course not OK; the value needs to be retrieved from the structure.

:::
::: exam-sample-answer

`movies["action"][1]["runtime"]`

:::
::: exam-marking-guidelines

* 0 points for answers being a statement
* 1 point for an answer that is an expression that works

    "name": "Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone",
    "language": "English"
}, {
    "name": "The Hobbit",
    "language": "English"
}]
```

Can be expressed in XML format.

:::
::: exam-sample-answer

    "name": "Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone",
    "language": "English"
}, {
    "name": "The Hobbit",

## Question 15 (1p)
:::: exam-question-container
::: exam-question

When you need to use a loop in Python, explain when you should use a `for` loop, and when you should use a `while` loop.

:::
::: exam-sample-answer

When the purpose of the loop is to iterate over values that are known before the loop starts (for example values in a list), then it's better to use the `for` loop.

When you can't compute a sequence of values to iterate over before the loops starts (for example when you should continue to ask the user to enter more data until the user doesn't want to enter any more data), then you should use the `while` loop.

:::
::: exam-marking-guidelines

* 0.5 points for general description of when a `for` loop should be used
    * Only 0.4 points if only an example is provided
* 0.5 points for general description of when a `while` loop should be used
    * Only 0.4 points if only an example is provided
* A few point reductions for answers that say strange things

**Note** Many students explain how the loops work as their answers. The question was not to explain how the loops work, but to explain when you should use which one.

**Note** Many students give examples of when it's better to use the `for` loop, and when it's better to use the `while` loop. That would be an excellent answer if the question would have been *Give examples of when it's better to use the `for` loop, and when it's better to use the `while` loop*, but that is not the question.

Overall many answers have been very hard to read, but I have been quite generous with the number of points you have got on this question.

## Question 16 (1p)
:::: exam-question-container
::: exam-question

What will be stored in the variable `sum` after the following code has been executed?

```python

## Question 17 (1p)
:::: exam-question-container
::: exam-question

Implement the function `get_month_name`, which receives an integer as argument representing the month of the year (`1` for `January`, `2` for `February`, etc.), and returns the name of that month in English. You only need to support the months showed in the table below.

| Month of Year | Month Name |
|---|---|
| 1 | January |
| 2 | February |
| 3 | March |
| 4 | April |
| 5 | May |

If the month of the year is none of the ones found in the table above, return the string `"Invalid month"`.

Sample usage:

```
get_month_name(3)   â†’   "March"
get_month_name(8)   â†’   "Invalid month"
```

:::
::: exam-sample-answer

```python
month_names = ["January", "February", "March", "April", "May"]

def get_month_name(month_of_year):
    if 1 <= month_of_year and month_of_year <= len(month_names):
        return month_names[month_of_year - 1]
    else:
        return "Invalid month"

## Question 18 (2p)
:::: exam-question-container
::: exam-question

Write a program that keeps asking the user to enter an integer until the user enters `stop`. The program should then compute and print the sum of the last 3 integers the user entered. When running the program, it can look like this (bold text represents text entered by the user).

<div style="font-family: 'Courier New';">

Enter an integer or stop: **2**\
Enter an integer or stop: **6**\
Enter an integer or stop: **4**\
Enter an integer or stop: **5**\
Enter an integer or stop: **2**\
Enter an integer or stop: **stop**\
The sum of the last three entered integers is 11.

</div>

**Note**: The output should look precisely as in the example above (including white-spaces, but with the exception of the boldness from the input, of course).

**Note**: You can expect the user to actually enter a number or `stop` (no error handling needed).

**Note**: You can expect the user to enter at least three numbers before entering `stop`.

:::
::: exam-sample-answer

```python
numbers = []

entered_text = ""

while entered_text != "stop":
    
    entered_text = input("Enter an integer or stop: ")
    
    if entered_text != "stop":
        numbers.append(int(entered_text))

sum = numbers[-1] + number[-2] + numbers[-3]

print("The sum of the last three entered integers is "+str(sum)+".")

## Question 21 (3p)
:::: exam-question-container
::: exam-question

Below is some data about houses owned by some humans.

```python
houses = [
   {"owner": "Alice", "name": "Alice's Palace", "number_of_rooms": 9, "number_of_windows": 20},
   {"owner": "Alice", "name": "Alice's Home",   "number_of_rooms": 3, "number_of_windows": 5},
   {"owner": "Alice", "name": "Alice's Cabin",  "number_of_rooms": 1, "number_of_windows": 4},
   {"owner": "Bob",   "name": "Bob's Home",     "number_of_rooms": 4, "number_of_windows": 16},
   {"owner": "Bob",   "name": "Bob's Cabin",    "number_of_rooms": 1, "number_of_windows": 1}
]
```

It's cold in the winter, and it costs money to heat the houses. To heat a single house costs:

* 100 SEK each month...
* ...+ 10 SEK each month for each room in the house...
* ...+ 50 SEK each month for each window in the house

Write code that first computes which human that must pay the highest heating cost per month for all the houses that human owns combined, and then prints the name of the house that human owns with the highest heating cost. The correct answer for the data given above is `Alice's Palace`.

**Note**: Your code should still work as expected if one adds/removes houses to/from the list. `Alice` and `Bob` are not the only ones who can own a house.

## Question 22 (2p)
:::: exam-question-container
::: exam-question

The class `MultiplicationTest` represents a multiplication test the user can take. The one using the class gets to determine which multiplication table the test should cover (e.g. `4`), and the test should then contain the questions `0` to `9` (e.g `4 * 0`, `4 * 1`, ..., `4 * 9`). The class has the following constructor/methods:

| Constructor/Method | Description |
|---|---|
| `MultiplicationTest(table)` | Creates a new test for the given `table`(number). |
| `is_all_questions_answered()` | Returns `True` if all questions in the test has been answered, otherwise `False` |
| `get_current_question()` | Returns a string with the current question to answer, e.g. `"4 * 7"` |
| `process_answer_to_current_question(answer)` | Registers the number `answer` as the user's answer to the current question in the test. Will also set the next question in the test to be the current question in the test. |
| `get_score()` | Returns the percentage (number between `0` and `100`) of the correct answers the user entered. |

Write a program making use of the class. In the program, you should first ask the user which multiplication table to use. Then you should continue to show the current question in the test and ask the user to enter an answer for that question until all questions have been answered, after which you should print the result.

Sample usage:

<div style="font-family: monospace; padding-left: 2em;">

Enter multiplication table: **4**\
Enter the product of 4 * 0: **-1**\
Enter the product of 4 * 1: **4**\
Enter the product of 4 * 2: **8**\
Enter the product of 4 * 3: **12**\
Enter the product of 4 * 4: **16**\
Enter the product of 4 * 5: **20**\
Enter the product of 4 * 6: **24**\
Enter the product of 4 * 7: **28**\
Enter the product of 4 * 8: **32**\
Enter the product of 4 * 9: **36**\
You got 90.0% correct.

</div>

**Note**: The output should look precisely as in the example above (including white-spaces, but with the exception of the boldness from the input, of course).

**Note**: No error handling is needed; you can expect the user to always enter a number.

```python
table = int(input("Enter multiplication table: "))

test = MultiplicationTest(table)

while not test.is_all_questions_answered():
    answer = int(input("Enter the product of "+test.get_current_question()+": "))
    test.process_answer_to_current_question(answer)

print("You got "+str(test.get_score())+"% correct.")

* 2 points for an answer that largely works
* Point reduction for errors:
    * -0.25 points for each unnecessary method call
    * -0.25 points for each printed output not looking as expected
    * -0.25 points for `int + string`
    * -0.25 points for spelling name of variable wrong
    * -1 point if everything is kind of right, but not using a loop
    * -1.5 points for not using any object, but only calling functions
