# Exam 2023-08-14
Here you find the questions, sample answers and marking guidelines for the exam 2023-08-14.

## Information
Start by reading through all questions. Peter will not visit the exam. If you find any question unclear, ask one of the exam administrators (*tentavakt* in Swedish) to call Peter, and he will clarify the question over the phone.

Max score is 25 points.

* For grade 3, 40% of max score (10 points) is required
* For grade 4, 60% of max score (15 points) is required
* For grade 5, 80% of max score (20 points) is required

During the test, you are only allowed to use:

* The computer you sit at to only answer the questions on this exam (you may not run any other program)
* A dictionary to translate to/from English from/to your native language
* Pen and paper to sketch/write notes with (does not need to be submitted)

Write your answers in either English or Swedish. If you write your answers in Swedish, make sure to not introduce any translation confusement. **Write proper sentences (spelling, upper/lower case characters, punctuation, etc.).** Answers that do not do this good enough/are vague/are ununderstandable cannot receive full score on the questions.

Answers that are more or less copies of sample answers given to you or copies of text found somewhere else will be rewarded 0 points. Use your own words to answer the questions (does not apply to questions where you write code).

Good luck!


## Question 1 (1p)
:::: exam-question-container
::: exam-question

Place the following lines of code in such order they can be executed (read underscores (`____`) as white-spaces/indentation (Inspera doesn't allow the text to begin with white-spaces ðŸ˜ž)).

* `____if year < 2050:`
* `____year = 2023 + number_of_years`
* `def program():`
* `____number_of_years = int(number_of_years)`
* `program()`
* `____number_of_years = input("Enter number of years: ")`
* `________print("That is soon!")`

You will get:

* 1 point for all in correct order

:::
::: exam-sample-answer

```python
def program():
    number_of_years = input("Enter number of years: ")
    number_of_years = int(number_of_years)
    year = 2023 + number_of_years

## Question 6 (1p)
:::: exam-question-container
::: exam-question

Bart is assigned the task to implement a program that prints this:

<div style="font-family: monospace; padding-left: 2em;">

B-a-r-t

</div>

Bart writes the following code:

```python
original_name = "Bart"
dashed_name = ""

for c in original_name:
    dashed_name = dashed_name + c
    dashed_name = dashed_name + "-"

print(dashed_name)
```

Bart's solution does not work as it should. Explain what output it currently produces, and suggest how the program can be fixed by adding a single if statement to the code (explain where in the code it should be added, and what the condition should be).

:::
::: exam-sample-answer

The code currently produces `B-a-r-t-`. That is, there's one `-` too much at the end. The if statement can be used to add `-` in each iteration in the loop except the last one. In the last iteration, `c` has the value `"t"`, which it doesn't have in any other iteration, so checking that `c` is not equal to `"t"` is something we can use to add `-` in all iterations except the last one.

So instead of having:

```python
dashed_name = dashed_name + "-"
```

We can use:

```python
if c != "t":
    dashed_name = dashed_name + "-"
```

:::

## Question 8 (1p)
:::: exam-question-container
::: exam-question

What non-negative integers should be assigned to the variables `x` and `y` to slice out the values `"a"`, `"b"`, `"c"`, `"d"` and `"e"` in the code below?

```python
my_list = ["a", "b", "c", "d", "e"]
x = ?
y = ?
my_new_list = my_list[x:y]
# my_new_list should now be ["a", "b", "c", "d", "e"]

## Question 9 (1p)
:::: exam-question-container
::: exam-question

Write the following code:

```python
my_list = [x < 10 for x in y if x != 0]
```

As statements using a loop instead. Your own code should have the exact same meaning as the code above.

## Question 10 (1p)
:::: exam-question-container
::: exam-question

Here is a quite complex structure with information about different movies:

```python
movies = {
    "action": [
        {"name": "GoldenEye", "runtime": 110},
        {"name": "Mission Impossible", "runtime": 115},
        {"name": "Pearl Harbor", "runtime": 160}
    ],
    "drama": [
        {"name": "Titanic", "runtime": 180},
        {"name": "Love Actually", "runtime": 120}
    ]
}
```

Given this very structure, write an **expression** that evaluates to the runtime of the movie with the name `Titanic`, i.e. `180`.

**Note**: Do not write a statement, and simply writing `180` is of course not OK; the value needs to be retrieved from the structure.

:::
::: exam-sample-answer

`movies["drama"][0]["runtime"]`

* 0 points for an answer being a statement
* 1 point for an answer that is an expression that works
    * -0.25 points for not having `movies` in the beginning
    * -0.25 points for missing a closing square bracket
    * -0.5 points for not having quotes around `drama` or `runtime`

## Question 11 (1p)
:::: exam-question-container
::: exam-question

Suggest how the data in the Python code below:

```python
heroes = [{
    "name": "Link",
    "color": "green"
}, {
    "name": "Mario",
    "color": "red"
}]
```

Can be expressed in XML format.

**Note**: This question is not about writing Python code, but XML code.

## Question 14 (1p)
:::: exam-question-container
::: exam-question

Implement the function `get_type()`, which receives a none-negative integer as argument representing the age of a human, and should return the string:

* `"baby"`, if the age is between `0` and `1` (both inclusive)
* `"kid"`, if the age is between `2` and `12` (both inclusive)
* `"teen"`, if the age is between `13` and `19` (both inclusive)
* `"adult"` otherwise

Sample usage:

```
get_type( 1)   â†’   "baby"
get_type(12)   â†’   "kid"
get_type(13)   â†’   "teen"
get_type(50)   â†’   "adult"
```

:::

        return "baby"
    elif age <= 12:
        return "kid"
    elif age <= 19:

## Question 15 (2p)
:::: exam-question-container
::: exam-question

Write a program that keeps asking the user to enter an integer until the user enters `stop`. The program should then print each even integer the user entered back to the user, each on its own line. To check if `an_integer` is even, you can use the expression `an_integer % 2 == 0`. When running the program, it can look like this (bold text represents text entered by the user).

<div style="font-family: 'Courier New';">

Enter an integer or stop: **8**\
Enter an integer or stop: **3**\
Enter an integer or stop: **4**\
Enter an integer or stop: **9**\
Enter an integer or stop: **5**\
Enter an integer or stop: **6**\
Enter an integer or stop: **stop**\
The even integers you entered are:\
8\
4\
6

</div>

**Note**: The output should look precisely as in the example above (including white-spaces, but with the exception of the boldness from the input, of course).

**Note**: You can expect the user to actually enter an integer or `stop` (no error handling needed).

:::
::: exam-sample-answer

```python
even_integers = []

entered_text = ""

while entered_text != "stop":
    
    entered_text = input("Enter an integer or stop: ")
    
    if entered_text != "stop":
        
        entered_integer = int(entered_text)
        
        if entered_integer % 2 == 0:
            even_integers.append(entered_integer)

print("The even integers you entered are:")

for even_integer in even_integers:
    print(even_integer)
```
:::
::: exam-marking-guidelines

* 2 points for a program that largely works
* Point reduction for small mistakes or doing weird things:
    * -0.25 points for using the entered integer as an integer before converting it to an integer
    * -0.25 points for having code doing unnecessary things

## Question 16 (2p)
:::: exam-question-container
::: exam-question

Implement the function `contains_two_odd`, which receives a list of integers, and returns:

* `True` if precisely two of the integers in the list are odd
* `False` otherwise

To check if `an_integer` is odd, you can use the expression `an_integer % 2 == 1`. 

Write two different implementations of the function: one using a `while` loop, and another one using a `for` loop.

Sample usage:

```
contains_two_odd([2, 1, 0, 3]) â†’ True
contains_two_odd([1, 1, 1, 2]) â†’ False
contains_two_odd([1, 2, 4]) â†’ False
contains_two_odd([]) â†’ False
contains_two_odd([1, 1]) â†’ True
```

:::
::: exam-sample-answer

```python
def contains_two_odd(integers):
    number_of_odd_integers = 0
    for integers in integers:
        if an_integer % 2 == 1:
            number_of_odd_integers += 1
    return number_of_odd_integers == 2

def contains_two_odd(integers):
    number_of_odd_integers = 0
    index = 0
    while index < len(integers):
        if integers[index] % 2 == 1:
            number_of_odd_integers += 1
        index += 1
    return number_of_odd_integers == 2

## Question 17 (3p)
:::: exam-question-container
::: exam-question

Below is some data about houses owned by some humans.

```python
houses = [
   {"owner": "Alice", "name": "Alice's Palace", "number_of_rooms": 9, "number_of_windows": 20},
   {"owner": "Alice", "name": "Alice's Home",   "number_of_rooms": 3, "number_of_windows": 5},
   {"owner": "Alice", "name": "Alice's Cabin",  "number_of_rooms": 1, "number_of_windows": 4},
   {"owner": "Bob",   "name": "Bob's Home",     "number_of_rooms": 4, "number_of_windows": 16},
   {"owner": "Bob",   "name": "Bob's Cabin",    "number_of_rooms": 1, "number_of_windows": 1}
]
```

It's hot in the summer, and it costs money to cool down the houses. To cool down a single house costs:

* 200 SEK each month...
* ...+ 20 SEK each month for each room in the house...
* ...+ 60 SEK each month for each window in the house

Write code that first computes who of `Alice` and `Bob` that owns the most expensive house to cool down. Then write code that computes how much that person needs to pay for cooling down all of his/her houses in total.

**Note**: Your code should still work as expected if one adds/removes houses to/from the list. `Alice` and `Bob` **are** the only ones who can own a house.

:::
::: exam-sample-answer

```python
cooling_down_base_cost_per_house = 200
cooling_down_cost_per_room = 20
cooling_down_cost_per_window = 60

    return (
        cooling_down_base_cost_per_house +
        cooling_down_cost_per_room * house["number_of_rooms"] +
        cooling_down_cost_per_window * house["number_of_windows"]
    )

# First compute the most expensive house to cool down.
most_expensive_house = houses[0]

for house in houses:
    if get_cooling_down_cost(most_expensive_house) < get_cooling_down_cost(house):
        most_expensive_house = house

owner = most_expensive_house["owner"]

# Then compute how much that person pays for all his/her houses.
total_cost = 0

for house in houses:
    if house["owner"] == owner:
        total_cost += get_cooling_down_cost(house)

print(owner+" has the most expensive house to cool down, and "+owner+" pays in total "+str(total_cost)+" to cool down all the houses.")

## Question 18 (2p)
:::: exam-question-container
::: exam-question

The class `Counter` represents a counter/number that can be changed.

The class has the following constructor/methods:

| Constructor/Method | Description |
|---|---|
| `Counter(start_number)` | Creates a new counter starting on the given `start_number` |
| `inc()` | Increments the counter by `1` |
| `reset()` | Sets the counter to the `start_number` it received through its constructor |
| `set_to(new_number)` | Sets the counter to `new_number` |
| `get_number()` | Returns the counter's current number |

Write a program making use of the class. In the program, you should continue to ask the user to enter commands that modify the counter (see the sample usage below) until the user enters `stop`. After each command, the counter's new value should be shown to the user.

Sample usage:

<div style="font-family: monospace; padding-left: 2em;">

Enter start value: **5**\
Enter command (inc/reset/set/stop): **inc**\
The counter is currently 6.\
Enter command (inc/reset/set/stop): **inc**\
The counter is currently 7.\
Enter command (inc/reset/set/stop): **reset**\
The counter is currently 5.\
Enter command (inc/reset/set/stop): **inc**\
The counter is currently 6.\
Enter command (inc/reset/set/stop): **set**\
Enter number: **0**\
The counter is currently 0.\
Enter command (inc/reset/set/stop): **inc**\
The counter is currently 1.\
Enter command (inc/reset/set/stop): **reset**\
The counter is currently 5.\
Enter command (inc/reset/set/stop): **stop**\
The counter is currently 5.

</div>

**Note**: The output should look precisely as in the example above (including white-spaces, but with the exception of the boldness from the input, of course). It is OK if the percentage numbers on the last two lines show decimal numbers.

**Note**: No error handling is needed; you can expect the user to always enter valid values.

```python
start_number = int(input("Enter start value: "))
