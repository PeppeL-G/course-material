If you're an old student that took this course a previous year but still have some examination tests left to pass you take those tests as they are described this year. The old Canvas Course won't be used any more, so join this year's Canvas Course, so we can keep track of your progress in the course this year there. If you aren't registered for the course this year, ask the course coordinator to invite you to the Canvas Course by sending an email message with the topic `Invitation to Canvas Course` to `peter.larsson-green@ju.se` with the content based on the template in <FigureNumber /> below.
