# Lab 1 Example
Here's a short example of another system designed in a similar way as described in Lab 1. The system here is a simple Ping Pong game (each user is expected to have their own instance of the system) users can play either against each other (over Bluetooth) or the computer . There's also a highscore system for playing against the computer, and there should exists three different level of difficulties (easy, medium and hard) on the computer.

## Actors
* User (Primary)

## Goals
| Actor | Goal |
|-------|------|
| User | Play VS Computer |
| User | Submit Highscore |
| User | View Highscores |
| User | Play VS Player as Host |
| User | Play VS Player as Joiner |

## Brief Descriptions
Below are brief descriptions of all use-cases.

### Play VS Computer
The user selects the option to play VS the computer. The user selects the game difficulty, and then the game starts. 

### Submit Highscore
The user <u>Play VS Computer</u>. After the game the user tells the system she wants to add her score to the highscore list together with her name (which she enters). 

### View Highscore
The user selects the option to view the highscore. The user is then presented the top 10 highscores and names in the game.

### Play VS Player as Host
The user selects the option to play VS another player as the host. The user sees a list of nearby devices that want to <u> VS Player as Joiner</u>. The user selects one of them, and then the game starts.

### Play VS Player as Joiner
The user selects the option to join a <u> VS Player as Host</u> game. The system waits till another device hosting a game accepts playing against this user, then the game starts.
