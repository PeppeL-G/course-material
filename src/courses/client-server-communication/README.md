# Welcome!
Welcome to the course *Client-Server Communication*! In this course you'll learn how to create software systems consisting of two parts: a client application and a server application. It will be very similar to how traditional web applications works, but in this course we will focus on implementing an API on the server any type of client can use to communicate with it (such as a smartphone application), and not only web browsers. And to practice on using APIs you'll also learn how to create Single-Page Applications using a frontend framework.

::: warning Note to old students
