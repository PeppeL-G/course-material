# Tutorials
Here is the source code from the tutorials available. To run them on your own computer:

1. Unzip the ZIP file.
2. Go to the root folder of the application you unzipped and want to start.
3. Install all dependencies (npm packages) by executing the command `npm install`.
4. Start the application using `npm run serve` for Vue.js applications and `node app.js` (or similar) for Express applications.

The source code makes use of [the npm package `chuck-norris-api`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/chuck-norris-api). I never showed you how to install it during the tutorial, but it is installed when you run `npm install`.
