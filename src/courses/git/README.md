# Git
This is not an actual course given at Jönköping University. Instead, it's an improvised mini course teaching you the basics in Git, something that every programmer should know these days. It is very useful when you are multiple programmers working on the same project at the same time.

## Learning Resources
Here is a list of the resources used in this mini course. They will be introduced to you in the lectures.

* The program [git](https://git-scm.com/)
* The book [Pro Git](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2) by *Scott Chacon* and *Ben Straub* (available for free online in multiple different formats).
* The website [Visualizing Git](http://git-school.github.io/visualizing-git/).
* The website [Learn Git Branching](https://learngitbranching.js.org/).
* The website [git - the simple guide](https://rogerdudler.github.io/git-guide/).
