# Welcome!
Welcome to the course *Web Development - Advanced Concepts*!

## Introduction
This is a follow up course to [Web Development Fundamentals](../web-development-fundamentals/), so you are expected to already know how to create web applications storing resources in a database and all the other things you learned in that course. In this course we will focus more on web applications exposing a REST API Single-Page Applications can use to store the data they need to store.

This website will be used to host the course material only. Canvas will primarily be used to:

* Send info to you through announcements (be sure to have your global notification settings or your course notification settings enabled)
* Organize you into lab groups and project groups (see the People page)
* Keep track of your progress in the course (passed lab assignments) (see the Modules page and the Grades page)

Read the [Study Guide](./study-guide/) for the details.

## Information to old students
If you're an old student that took this course a previous year but still have some examination tests left to pass you take those tests as they are described this year. The old Canvas course won't be used any more, so join this year's Canvas course, so we can keep track of your progress in the course this year there. If you aren't registered for the course this year, ask the course coordinator to invite you to the Canvas course by sending him an email message based on the template in <FigureNumber /> below with the topic `Invitation to Canvas Course` to `peter.larsson-green@ju.se`.

If you're almost done with the project work you have started a previous year, it might be OK to finish that this year, instead of completing the project per the description this year. Contact the course coordinator **within 1 week** after the course has started for a discussion if you want to continue on your old project.
