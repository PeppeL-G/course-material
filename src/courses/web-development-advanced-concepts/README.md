# Welcome!
Welcome to the course *Web Development - Advanced Concepts*! This is a follow up course to [Web Development Fundamentals](../web-development-fundamentals/), so you are expected to already know how to create web applications storing resources in a database and the things you learned in that course. In this course you will learn how to create web applications as well, but they will be bigger and better by using things like a three-layered architecture, dependency injection, client-side JavaScript and Docker.

::: danger Corona restrictions
Due to the current pandemic, all teaching (lectures, lab sessions, etc.) will be conducted online, and students are encouraged to study from home if possible. For more information, read JU's page [Updated information regarding the coronavirus](https://ju.se/en/about-us/jonkoping-university/information-material/updated-information-regarding-the-coronavirus.html).
:::

This website will be used to host the course material only. If you take this course, you must also join [the course's Canvas page](https://ju.instructure.com/courses/3372). Students registered for this course should have been added to that page automatically. The Canvas page will be used to keep track of your progress in the course, to distribute you among the lab session groups, to handle submission of your project work, etc. You should only need to use Canvas when you are instructed to do that on this website (e.g. when submitting your project work). You will also receive information through announcements posted on Canvas, so you probably want to make sure notifications (through email or push notifications to the Canvas Android/iOS app) for those events are enable on Canvas.

::: warning Note to old students
If you're an old student that took this course a previous year but still have some examination tests left to pass you take those tests as they are described this year. The old Ping Pong event won't be used any more, so join this year's Canvas page, so we can keep track of your progress in the course this year there. If you aren't registered for the course this year, ask the course coordinator to invite you to the Canvas page by sending him an email message based on the template in <FigureNumber /> below with the topic `Invitation to Canvas Course` to `peter.larsson-green@ju.se`.
