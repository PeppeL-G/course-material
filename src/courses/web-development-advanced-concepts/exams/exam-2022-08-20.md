# Exam 2022-08-20
Here you find sample answers and marking guidelines to the questions on the exam 2022-08-20.

---

Start by reading through all questions.

Max score is 30 points.

* For grade 3, 40% of max score (12 points) is required
* For grade 4, 60% of max score (18 points) is required
* For grade 5, 80% of max score (24 points) is required

You are not allowed to use anything but:

* The computer you sit at to only answer the questions on this exam
* A dictionary to translate to/from English from/to your native language
* Pen and paper to sketch with (should not be submitted)

Write your answers in either English or Swedish. If you write your answers in Swedish, make sure to not introduce any translation confusement. **Write proper sentences (spelling, upper/lower case characters, punctuation, etc.).** Each answer that contains multiple obvious errors, such as:

* A sentence starting with a lower case character
* A sentence not ending with a period, question mark, or any other suitable character
* A sentence that is incomplete
* A sentence that is incomprehensible

Will automatically lose 0.25 points. The ability to express yourself in text clearly is very important for an engineer, and therefor part of the examination.

Answers that are more or less copies of sample answers given to you or copies of text found somewhere else will be rewarded 0 points. Use your own words to answer the questions.

Good luck!

## Client-side

### Question 1 (1p)
<ExamQuestion>
<template v-slot:question>

An SPA can be implemented without updating the URI in the web browser when the user change what main content should be shown in the SPA. However, it's usually stupid to not update the URI to reflect it. Explain why. 

</template>
<template v-slot:sample-answer>

The web is built on the principle that URIs should identify different pages (the content on different pages). If not used correctly, bookmarking a page won't work, sending a link to a friend won't work, search engines won't be able to properly index your website and send the user directly to the right webpage on your website, etc. 

</template>
<template v-slot:marking-guidelines>



</template>
</ExamQuestion>




### Question 2 (1p)
<ExamQuestion>
<template v-slot:question>

In JavaScript, explain the difference between:

```js
aFunction(anotherFunction)
```

and:

```js
aFunction(anotherFunction())
```

</template>
<template v-slot:sample-answer>

`aFunction(x)` will call the function stored in the variable `aFunction` and pass it the value stored in the `x` variable.

`aFunction(x())` will first call the function stored in the `x` variable, and the return value from that function will be passed to the function stored in the variable `aFunction`.

</template>
<template v-slot:marking-guidelines>

* 0.5 points for explaining the problem
* 0.5 points for suggesting a correct fix

</template>
</ExamQuestion>




### Question 3 (1p)
<ExamQuestion>
<template v-slot:question>

Name 3 different client-side JS events that can fire on a webpage.

</template>
<template v-slot:sample-answer>

* `click`
* `submit`
* `DOMContentLoaded`

</template>
<template v-slot:marking-guidelines>

* 0.33 points for each correct name

</ExamQuestion>




### Question 4 (2p)
<ExamQuestion>
<template v-slot:question>

Is the code below good or bad? Justify your answer.

```js
function showAccountsPage(){
    
    const pageDiv = document.querySelector('#accounts-page')
    pageDiv.innerHTML = ""
    
    const header = document.createElement('h1')
    header.innerHTML = "Accounts"
    pageDiv.appendChild(header)
    
    const loadingP = document.createElement('p')
    loadingP.innerHTML = "Loading..."
    pageDiv.appendChild(loadingP)
    
    fetch("/api/accounts").then(function(response){
        
        return response.json()
        
    }).then(function(accounts){
        
        pageDiv.removeChild(loadingP)
        
        const ul = document.createElement('ul')
        
        for(const account of accounts){
            
            const li = document.createElement('li')
            ul.appendChild(li)
            
            const a = document.createElement('a')
            a.href = "/accounts/"+account.id
            a.innerHTML = account.username
            li.appendChild(a)
            
        }
        
        pageDiv.appendChild(ul)
        
    }).catch(function(error){
        
        pageDiv.removeChild(loadingP)
        
        const p = document.createElement('p')
        p.innerHTML = "Failed to load accounts"
        pageDiv.appendChild(p)
        
    })
    
}
```

</template>
<template v-slot:sample-answer>

`a.innerHTML = account.username` introduces a XSS vulnerability, so no, the code is not good.

## Scaling

### Question 6 (2p)
<ExamQuestion>
<template v-slot:question>

Explain in which context you use a load balancer. And when using a load balancer with a website, describe the problems that comes with it (at least two different problems), and describe one solution of your choice to each problem.

</template>
<template v-slot:sample-answer>



</template>
<template v-slot:marking-guidelines>

* 0.5 points for description of vertical scaling
* 0.5 points for description of horizontal scaling
* 1 point for justifying why horizontal scaling is harder
    * (many use *sessions* as argument for why horizontal scaling is harder, but using sticky sessions, you don't need to change any of the code in your application, so not really a valid argument, but I have accepted it to some degree anyway)

</template>
</ExamQuestion>



## Server-side

### Question 7 (3p)
<ExamQuestion>
<template v-slot:question>

Explain what a three-layered architecture is, which parts it consists of and what each part is used for. Then also explain how web applications use a three-layered architecture.

Don't write any code.

</template>
<template v-slot:sample-answer>

A three-layered architecture is a way organize the code of an application in three different layers, each with their own responsibilities:

* The *Data Access Layer* contains the code for storing and retrieving the application's data. It usually provides CRUD (Create, Read, Update and Delete) operations for this
* The *Business Logic Layer* contains the code for carrying out the tasks the user wants to do (i.e. the application's functionality), such as computing how much the user should pay for the products put in a shopping bag, verify payments, etc. It typically contains authorization checks (for example, only allowing the user to use the application if the user has a paid membership or if the test period is not over yet) and validation checks (for example, checking if the data the user sends to the application is in correct format). Is uses the Data Access Layer when needed
* The *Presentation Layer* is responsible for implementing an interface through which the application can be used, for example a graphical user interface that humans can use. When the user interacts with the application through the interface, for example clicks on a button, the Presentation Layer asks the Business Logic Layer to execute the task that is associated with the button

In web applications, the Presentation Layer is responsible for receiving HTTP requests, and then ask the Business Logic Layer to carry out the requests. The Data Access Layer often store the data in a database. The Presentation Layer is also responsible for generating the HTTP response to send back, containing the HTML and CSS code the web browser use to display the webpage in the response to the user.

</template>
<template v-slot:marking-guidelines>

* 0.5 points for what it is
* 0.25 points for what each part's name is
* 0.25 points for what each part is used for
* 0.5 points for how web app use it (HTTP, HTML, CSS in Presentation Layer, and description of the other layers)
* 0.5 points for good quality answers (many details, not using different names to describe the same thing, using the correct name on things, write proper and easy to read sentences, clearly explain which layer making use of which other layer, use singular and plural correctly, etc.)

::: warning Note!
Answering *Explain what a three-layered architecture is* with something like *It's an architecture*, or *It's an architecture consisting of three layers* is of course not a good way to do it. Anyone gets that understanding by just reading the name. You have to explain what it's an architecture of, and what that means (what is a layer? what does a layer consist of? Etc.).

The Presentation Layer doesn't have to make use of HTML and HTTP. This architecture can not only be used in web applications, but other type of applications too.

The Data Access Layer does not have to store data in a database. It's not called *Database Access Layer*.

Some students write the layers are independent of each other/know nothing about each others. That is not true. If it would be true, then would, for example, the Presentation Layer have no way of using the Business Logic Layer.

Many students write that the Presentation Layer receives HTTP requests, and then sends the requests to the Business Logic Layer. It really sounds like you're saying *the Business Logic Layer obtains the HTTP request*, and that is wrong; the Business Logic Layer shouldn't know the Presentation Layer makes use of HTTP at all, and therefor it can't receive HTTP requests from it. Saying that the Business Logic Layers *carries out* the request, or similar, is OK, because that does not imply the Business Logic Layers receives the HTTP request.

### Question 8 (1p)
<ExamQuestion>
<template v-slot:question>

On a web application implemented with a three-layered architecture, explain why the code related to sessions are only found in the Presentation Layer, and never in the other two layers.

</template>
<template v-slot:sample-answer>

It is only the Presentation Layer that knows the app is a web application, and therefor the only layer that knows that sessions are needed.

</template>
<template v-slot:marking-guidelines>

* 0.33 points for each correct name/explanation

</template>
</ExamQuestion>




### Question 9 (1p)
<ExamQuestion>

<template v-slot:sample-answer>



</template>
<template v-slot:marking-guidelines>

* 1 point for no authorization info is missing

</template>
</ExamQuestion>




## REST API

### Question 11 (1p)
<ExamQuestion>
<template v-slot:question>

Match each HTTP status code with its reason phrase.

Status codes: `200` `201` `204` `404` `500`

Reason Phrases: `No Content` `OK` `Created` `Not Found` `Internal Server Error`

All needs to be matched correct to get any points.

</template>
<template v-slot:sample-answer>

* `200`: `OK`
* `201`: `Created`
* `204`: `No Content`
* `404`: `Not Found`
* `500`: `Internal Server Error`

</template>
<template v-slot:marking-guidelines>

* 1 point for all correct

</template>
</ExamQuestion>




### Question 12 (1p)
<ExamQuestion>
<template v-slot:question>

In a REST API, to create a new account one should send an HTTP request looking like this (`XXX` should be replaced with what is suitable):

```http
POST /create-account HTTP/1.1
Host: www.the-website.com
Content-Type: application/json
Content-Length: XXX

{"username": "XXX", "password": "XXX"}
```

Is this part of the REST API good designed? Justify your answer.

</template>
<template v-slot:sample-answer>



</template>
<template v-slot:marking-guidelines>

* 1 point for correct answer and valid justification

</template>
</ExamQuestion>




### Question 13 (3p)

</template>
<template v-slot:sample-answer>



</template>
<template v-slot:marking-guidelines>

### Question 14 (1p)
<ExamQuestion>
<template v-slot:question>

Does an ID Token have to be a JWT? Justify your answer.

</template>
<template v-slot:sample-answer>

Yes, the OpenID Connect specification specifies it has to be a JWT.

</template>
<template v-slot:marking-guidelines>

* 1 point for correct answer and valid justification

</template>
</ExamQuestion>



## Security





### Question 15 (1p)
<ExamQuestion>
<template v-slot:question>

If a REST API uses JWT, does it also need to use HTTPS instead of HTTP? Or is it equally secure anyway? Justify your answer.

</template>
<template v-slot:sample-answer>

JWT and HTTPS are for different things (JWT for authentication/authorization, HTTPS for secure communication), so one of them can't be used instead of the other; HTTPS must be used. Otherwise hackers using the same network as the user can read the data the user sends and receives.

</template>
<template v-slot:marking-guidelines>

* 1 point for correct answer and valid justification

</template>
</ExamQuestion>






### Question 16 (1p)
<ExamQuestion>
<template v-slot:question>

Give an example of a client-side JS cross-site HTTP request the web browser would send to a server even if the server doesn't support CORS.

An HTTP `GET` request you haven't added any own HTTP headers to.

</template>
<template v-slot:marking-guidelines>

* 1 point for a correct example

</template>
</ExamQuestion>




### Question 17 (2p)
<ExamQuestion>
<template v-slot:question>

Name (as good as you can) and describe how 2 different HTTP headers that is part of CORS works. Also show sample values they can have, and explain how those values work/should be interpreted.

</template>
<template v-slot:sample-answer>



</template>
<template v-slot:marking-guidelines>

* 0.25 points for used by **client-side code and web browsers** (just writing *website* is not enough)
* 0.25 points for a workaround for SOP/sending cross-site requests
* 0.25 points for description of simple request
* 0.5 points for description of preflight request
* 0.25 points for each description (name not required) of a CORS header (max 3)

</template>
</ExamQuestion>




## Code Writing




### Question 18 (1p)
<ExamQuestion>
<template v-slot:question>

To represent a human in JavaScript, one can use an object like:

```js
const human = {
    id: 1,
    name: "Alice",
    age: 10 // In years
}
```

Implement the JavaScript function `getAdultNames(humans)` which receives an array with human objects and returns a new array containing the name of the humans who are at least `18` years old.  The order of the names does not matter.

</template>
<template v-slot:sample-answer>

```js
const MIN_ADULT_AGE = 18

function getAdultNames(humans){
    
    const adultNames = []
    
    for(const human of humans){
        if(MIN_ADULT_AGE <= human.age){
            adultNames.push(human.name)
        }
    }
    
    return adultNames
    
}
```

</template>
<template v-slot:marking-guidelines>

* 1 point for a solution that largely works
* -0.1 points for using `.size` instead of `.length`
* -0.1 points for using `var` instead of `let`/`const`
* -0.1 points for each indentation error
* -0.1 points for being inconsistent with how `;` is used
* -0.1 points for using the condition `humans.length < 0`
* -0.2 points for creating variable inside loop that should be created outside loop
* -0.2 points for never initializing `oldestHuman`/initializing it wrong
* -0.2 points for `human > oldestHuman` instead of `human.age > oldestHuman.age`
* -0.2 points for checking `humans.length == 0` in the loop

</template>
</ExamQuestion>




### Question 19 (1p)
<ExamQuestion>
<template v-slot:question>

Implement the client-side JavaScript function `addToSummarizer(number)` which should return the sum of all numbers it has been called with.

Sample usage:

```js
addToSummarizer(5) // --> 5
addToSummarizer(3) // --> 8
addToSummarizer(5) // --> 13
```

</template>
<template v-slot:sample-answer>

```js
let sum = 0

function addToSummarizer(number){
    sum += number
    return sum
}
```

Or without polluting the top-level scope with the `sum` variable by using a self-executing function to introduce a new scope (not necessary for full score):

```js
const addToSummarizer = (function(){
    
    let sum = 0
    
    return function(number){
        sum += number
        return sum
    }
    
})()
```

* -0.1 points for not having semicolon after all statements (if that's the convention you use)
* -0.1 points for having same code in `if` and `else` (factor it out)
* -0.1 points for naming `isSumGreaterThan100` wrong
* -0.25 for implementing `!isSumGreaterThan100()`
* -0.25 for implementing `isSumGreaterThan_OR_EQUAL_TO_100()`

</template>
</ExamQuestion>




### Question 20 (4p)
<ExamQuestion>
<template v-slot:question>

The function `getCategories()` can be used to fetch categories from the server like this:

```js
getCategories(function(error, categories){
    if(error){
        // Couldn't fetch the categories.
    }else{
        // Do something with the categories.
        // categories = [
        //   {id: 1, name: "Comedy"},
        //   {id: 2, name: "Drama"},
        //   ...
        // ]
    }
})
```

The function `getMoviesByCategoryId()` can be used to fetch movies from the server that belongs to a specific category, like this:

```js
getMoviesByCategoryId(1, function(error, movies){
    if(error){
        // Couldn't fetch the movies.
    }else{
        // Do something with the movies.
        // movies = [
        //   {id: 4, categoryId: 1, title: "Dumb and Dumber"},
        //   {id: 7, categoryId: 1, title: "Ace Ventura: Pet Detective"},
        //   ...
        // ]
    }
})
```

Implement the function `getCategoriesWithMovies(callback)` which should fetch all categories, and for each category fetch all movies, and pass them all to the `callback` function like this:

```js
getCategoriesWithMovies(function(error, categories){
    if(error){
        // Couldn't fetch the categories or the movies.
    }else{
        // Do something with the categories and movies.
        // categories = [
        //   {
        //     id: 1,
        //     name: "Comedy",
        //     movies: [
        //       {id: 4, categoryId: 1, title: "Dumb and Dumber"},
        //       {id: 7, categoryId: 1, title: "Ace Ventura: Pet Detective"},
        //       ... (more movies...)
        //     ]
        //   },
        //   ... (more categories with movies)
        // ]
    }
})
```

Important details:

* The callback function should be called only once
* As soon as any function gives an error, the callback function should be called with that error (the other argument should be `null`)
* If all data is successfully fetched, the callback function should be called with `null` as the error, and the categories array (with the movies) as the second argument
* The order of the categories and the movies is not important

Implement two different versions of the function:

* One version that fetches data in sequential order (one at a time)
* One version that fetches data in parallel (as fast as possible)

</template>
<template v-slot:sample-answer>

```js
// Sequential
function getCategoriesWithMovies(callback){
    
    getCategories(function(categoriesError, categories){
        
        if(categoriesError){
            callback(categoriesError)
            return

        let categoryIndex = 0
        
        fetchNextCategoryMovies()
        
        function fetchNextCategoryMovies(){
            
            if(categoryIndex == categories.length){
                callback(null, categories)
                return
            }

                category.movies = movies
                categoryIndex += 1
                
                fetchNextCategoryMovies()
                
            })
            
        }
        
    })
    
}
```

```js
// Parallel

            return
        }
        
        let hasSentBackError = false
        let gotMoviesCounter = 0
        
        for(const category of categories){
            
            getMoviesByCategoryId(category.id, function(moviesError, movies){
                
                if(moviesError && !hasSentBackError){
                    hasSentBackError = true
                    callback(moviesError, null)
                    return
                }
                
                category.movies = movies
                
                gotMoviesCounter += 1
                
                if(gotMoviesCounter == categories.length){
                    callback(null, categories)
                }
                
            })
            
        }
        
    })
    
}
```
