## Question 6 (1p)
<ExamQuestion>
<template v-slot:question>

Carl is assigned the task to design a REST API. To delete movies in a specific genre a specific year, he decides clients should send an HTTP `DELETE` request to `/movies`, add the header `Content-Type: application/json` and in the body of the request add `{"year": 2000, "genre": "drama"}` (change `2000` and `"drama"` to desired values).

Is this a good or bad REST API design? Justify your answer.

**Note**: You don't need to worry about authorization in this question.

</template>
<template v-slot:sample-answer>

The `Content-Type` header is used in HTTP requests and responses to tell the receiver in which data format the body of the request/response is written in.

The `Accept` header is used in HTTP requests to specify which data format the body in the HTTP response should (preferably) be written in.

</template>

<template v-slot:sample-answer>



</template>
<template v-slot:marking-guidelines>

* 2 point for correct answer and motivating why horizontal is harder (requires description of both ways).

</template>
</ExamQuestion>



## Question 9 (2p)
<ExamQuestion>
<template v-slot:question>

Alice is assigned the task to design a REST API clients can use to login and then create new blogposts belonging to that account. She decides that when a user logs in, the client obtains an access token (`THE.ACCESS.TOKEN`) containing the user's account id, which can be used to act on the behalf of that user. Then when the user wants to create a new blogpost belonging to her own account, the client sends an HTTP `POST` request to `/blogposts` with the headers `Authorization: Bearer THE.ACCESS.TOKEN` and `Content-Type: application/json`, and in the body pass `{"title": "The actual title", "content": "The blogpost text."}`.

Is this a good or bad design? Justify your answer.

</template>
<template v-slot:sample-answer>



</template>
<template v-slot:marking-guidelines>

* 1 point for correct answer and justification.

</template>
</ExamQuestion>



## Question 10 (2p)
<ExamQuestion>
<template v-slot:question>

Explain what MVC is, which parts it consists of and what each part is used for. Then also explain how web applications use MVC.

Don't write any code.

</template>
<template v-slot:sample-answer>

MVC is a design pattern describing a way to design/structure the code for the graphical user interface part of an application.

The MVC design pattern consists of three different parts: models, views and controllers.

* A *Model* contains the data that should be visualized in the GUI.
* A *View* contains the code that visualizes the data in a Model. 
* A *Controller* picks which Model and View that should be used, and also listen for user interaction in the View and do what the user wants when the interactions happens, such as changing the data in the Model or using another View.

When web applications make use of the MVC design pattern, Controllers listen for incoming HTTP requests, and when they receive one, they create a Model with the data that should be sent back, and then passes that data to a View, which embeds it in HTML code, and then the Controller sends back the HTML code from the View.

<template v-slot:marking-guidelines>

* 0.5 points for what MVC is.
* 0.33 points for each part name and description of each part.
* 0.5 points for how web applications makes use of MVC (controllers use HTTP, Views produces HTML).

</template>
</ExamQuestion>



## Question 11 (3p)
<ExamQuestion>
<template v-slot:question>

Explain what a three-layered architecture is, which parts it consists of and what each part is used for. Then also explain how web applications use a three-layered architecture.

Don't write any code.

</template>
<template v-slot:sample-answer>

A three-layered architecture is a way organize the code of an application in three different layers, each with their own responsibilities:

* The *Data Access Layer* contains the code for storing and retrieving the data the application needs to store. It usually provides CRUD (Create, Read, Update and Delete) operations for this.
* The *Business Logic Layer* contains the code for carrying out the tasks the user wants, such as computing for how many days the user has been using the application, computing how much the user should pay for the products put in a shopping bag, etc. It also contains authorization (for example, only allow the user to use the application if the user has paid for the application of if the test period is not yet over) and validation (e.g. checking if data entered in forms are valid).
* The *Presentation Layer* is responsible for implementing an interface through which the application can be used, for example a graphical user interface that humans can use. When the interfaced is used (for example a button is clicked), the Presentation Layer asks the Business Logic Layer to execute the task the button is associated with.

In web applications, the Presentation Layer is responsible for receiving HTTP requests, and then ask the Business Logic Layer to carry out the requests. The Data Access Layer often store the data in a database. The Presentation Layer is also responsible for generating the HTTP response to send back, containing the HTML and CSS code the web browser use to display the webpage in the response.

</ExamQuestion>



## Question 13 (2p)
<ExamQuestion>
<template v-slot:question>

Explain what a JWT is, which parts it consists of and what each part is used for. Make sure to mention all details so the reader understand why they are secure to use.


</template>
<template v-slot:sample-answer>

A JSON Web Token (JWT) is a string that represents some data called *claims*. JWTs are self-contained, meaning the data is stored in the token itself (compared to other type of tokens that can be only identifiers for where the data is stored).

A JWT consists of three parts and has the format `aaa.bbb.ccc`:

* The `aaa` part is the Header. It contains meta information about the token, such as which type of token it is, and which algorithm that was used to compute the Signature (third part) of the token. This information is expressed as a JSON object, which then is encoded in Base64Url format.
* The `bbb` part is the Payload. It contains the claims the token represents. The claims are expressed as a JSON object, which then is encoded in Base64Url format.
* The `ccc` part is the Signature. The one who creates the token decides what should be put in the token (i.e. the `aaa` and `bbb` part), then it uses the algorithm specified in the Header to compute the Signature, which is a signed value of the `aaa.bbb` part. The creator can then use the Signature to verify that no one has changed the data in the token (e.g. compute it again in a token it receives, and see that it matches the Signature in the received token), i.e. the token was created by itself.

One way to compute the Signature is by hashing `aaa.bbb` concatenated with a secret string only the creator knows. This way, if a hacker changes the claims in the token after having received it, the creator will compute a different signature, and find the token invalid. For a hacker to make a valid token, she also needs to change the signature to a valid signature, but she can't do that since she doesn't know the secret string the creator is using.

</template>
<template v-slot:marking-guidelines>

* 0.25 points for "what it is" (`aaa.bbb.ccc` format, etc.).
* 0.25 points for each part name.
* 0.25 points for each part description.
* 0.25 points for answers that clearly explains why they are secure (among other things, that the server re-computes the signature each time it receives the token).

</template>
</ExamQuestion>



## Question 14 (1p)
<ExamQuestion>
<template v-slot:question>

In a three layered architecture, give an example of an implementation detail that should not be exposed to the next layer. Choose whichever layer you want. Justify your answer.

</template>

</template>
<template v-slot:marking-guidelines>

* 1 point for correct explanation.
* -0.25 points for saying ID Tokens are more secure.

</template>
</ExamQuestion>



## Question 15 (2p)
<ExamQuestion>
<template v-slot:question>

The function `addBlogpost()` is in a blogpost repository in the Data Access Layer of a three layered application that stores its resources in a relational database. On the website, users can create their own accounts and then create blogposts belonging to their own account.

```js
function addBlogpost(blogpost, callback){
    
    const query = `
        INSERT INTO blogposts (accountId, title, content) VALUES(?, ?, ?)
    `
    
    const values = [
        blogpost.accountId,
        blogpost.title,
        blogpost.content
    ]
    
    db.query(query, values, function(error, results){
        if(error){
            callback("DB Communication error.")
        }else{
            callback(null, results.insertId)
        }
    })
    
}
```

What's wrong with the current implementation of the function? Explain how you would solve that problem (in words, don't write any code).

## Question 18 (4p)
<ExamQuestion>
<template v-slot:question>

The function `getMovieById()` can be used to fetch a movie with a specific id asynchronously from the server like this:

```js
getMovieById(3, function(movie, error){
    if(error){
        // Couldn't fetch the movie.
    }else{
        // Do something with the movie.
        // movie = {id: 3, title: "Hello!", producerId: 123, categoryId: 45}
    }
})
```

The function `getProducerById()` can be used to fetch a producer with a specific id asynchronously from the server like this:

```js
getProducerById(5, function(producer, error){
    if(error){
        // Couldn't fetch the producer.
    }else{
        // Do something with the producer.
        // producer = {id: 5, name: "Robin"}
    }
})
```

The function `getCategoryById()` can be used to fetch a category with a specific id asynchronously from the server like this:

```js
getCategoryById(7, function(category, error){
    if(error){
        // Couldn't fetch the category.
    }else{
        // Do something with the category.
        // category = {id: 7, name: "Comedy"}
    }
})
```

Create the function `getMovieByIdWithProducerAndCategory()`, that fetches a movie with a specific id, and then fetches the producer and the category the movie belongs too, so it can be used like this:

```js
getMovieByIdWithProducerAndCategory(4, function(movie, producer, category, error){
    if(error){
        // Couldn't fetch all three resources.
    }else{
        // Could fetch all three resources.
        // movie = {id: 4, title: "Hello!", producerId: 32, categoryId: 45}
        // producer = {id: 32, name: "Jessie"}
        // category = {id: 45, name: "Horror"}
    }
})
```

Important details:

* The callback function should be called only one time.
* As soon as any function gives an error, the callback function should be called with that error (the other arguments should be `null`).
* The data should be fetched as fast as possible (loading times should be minimized).

</template>
<template v-slot:sample-answer>

```js
function getMovieByIdWithProducerAndCategory(movieId, callback){
    
    getMovieById(movieId, function(movie, error){
        
        if(error){
            callback(null, null, null, error)
        }else{

                fetchedProducer = producer
                sendBackIfDone()
            })
            
            getCategoryById(movie.categoryId, function(category, error){
                categoryError = error
                fetchedCategory = category

## Question 19 (1p)
<ExamQuestion>
<template v-slot:question>

The JavaScript function `setTimeout()` can be used to schedule a call to a function in the future. Example:

```js
setTimeout(function(){
    // The code here in the function runs 1000 ms later.
}, 1000)
```

The function `getInfo()` can be used to fetch some info from a server. Sample usage:

```js
getInfo(function(info){
    // This code runs when we have got the info.
})
```

As you can see, `getInfo()` is asynchronous, and it might take a few seconds before it has fetched the info from the server and passed it to the callback function.

Your task is to implement the function `getInfoOrFail()` that works according to the sample usage below.

```js
getInfoOrFail(function(didGetInfo, info){ // didGetInfo is a boolean.
    if(!didGetInfo){
        // The server did not send back info within 3 seconds.
    }else{
        // We got info within 3 seconds.
    }
})
```

The callback function passed to `getInfoOrFail()` should only be called once.

<template v-slot:marking-guidelines>

* 1 point for correct answer.
* -0.1 for passing wrong error to callback.
