That&#39;s why we recommend you to get continuos feedback on your work throughout the entire course by discussing it with a teacher at the lab sessions.</p><p>When marking the final submission of your work we need to read through and assess your work. Marking your work is not a <em>teaching activity</em>, but part of an <em>examination test</em>, so our feedback on your final submissions are not intended for you, but instead something we use ourselves to justify the grade we give you. But since it&#39;s also very valuable for you as a student to read it, I often share my feedback with you, so you can learn what you can improve. Since the feedback primarily is for me, <strong>my feedback on your work might be hard for you to read, and it will likely overall be incomplete</strong>.</p><h2 id="report-feedback" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#report-feedback" aria-hidden="true">#</a> Report Feedback</h2><p>If you&#39;ve submitted a report (PDF file), I will write my feedback as PDF comments in it.

I also tend to only comment on the things you have written, and not so much on all the things you should have written, but haven&#39;t.</p><p>Whenever I think the quality of your report is too poor to make you receive a passing grade on your entire project, I&#39;ll stop reading marking the rest of your work. Your grade has already been decided, and looking through your submitted code (if any) won&#39;t change that, so no point for me in doing that.</p><h2 id="code-feedback" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#code-feedback" aria-hidden="true">#</a> Code Feedback</h2><p>If your report is good enough to have a chance to pass, I&#39;ll start reading the code you have submitted (if any). I&#39;ll read through <strong>parts of it</strong> and comment anything I find suspicious/bad/incorrect. You&#39;ll later receive these comments. If I find too severe mistakes preventing you from getting a passing grade I usually stop looking for more mistakes, so <strong>students that need to improve their work often need to improve more things than just the things I&#39;ve commented on</strong>.</p><div class="custom-container warning"><p class="custom-container-title">Getting code feedback does not mean the report is good</p><p>If you receive comments on your code, that does not necessarily mean your report is good. It (in most case) means that the poorer parts of your report can be outweighed by high quality code, and you still had a chance to get a passing grade in total. If you didn&#39;t get that, you are strongly recommended to improve both the report and your code for next revision.</p></div><h2 id="final-grade" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#final-grade" aria-hidden="true">#</a> Final Grade</h2><p>The final grade I give you on your work is not only based on my written feedback. While looking through your work I&#39;ll also assess your work per the grading guidelines (available in most of my courses), and I&#39;ll also assess how well your work is overall. All of this is then taken into account for the final grade.</p><h2 id="revisions" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#revisions" aria-hidden="true">#</a> Revisions</h2><p>The students who need to improve their work to get a passing grade often wants to get <em>a minimal list of things to fix to get a passing grade</em>. My feedback is no such list. The closest you&#39;ll get to such a list is by reading through the project instructions, the hinting text in the project report template and the project grading guidelines. Together they should give you a very good understanding of what&#39;s required to receive a passing grade.</p><p>It might not be necessary for you to fix all the things I&#39;ve commented on to get a passing grade. When you submit your revision I&#39;ll make a new assessment of your entire work from scratch. This time it might overall be good enough to get a passing grade, even if you just improved the report, or just improved the code. I strongly recommend you to fix all the things I&#39;ve commented on, but if you want to gamble it&#39;s up to you.</p><div class="custom-container warning"><p class="custom-container-title">I&#39;ll miss commenting on some bad things</p><p>When I read through a revision I might notice mistakes/errors that were there already in the first submission, but I never commented on. For the student, that <strong>does not mean</strong> <em>I don&#39;t need to fix that since you didn&#39;t comment on it before, so I had no idea that it was something I needed to fix</em>. To learn what you need to deliver to pass, read through the project instructions, the project grading guidelines and the hints in the report template. My feedback is incomplete, since I&#39;ll miss commenting on some things, and anyway don&#39;t have time to comment on all things.</p></div><p>Many students often submit revisions 1-2 hours after they&#39;ve received my feedback. Most likely it will take more than 1-2 hours to improve your work to make it good enough to receive a passing grade. These students often also want me to mark their submissions as soon as they have submitted their revisions. That will not happen. The deadlines for submitting revisions are at the same time as for the re-exam of the written examination in my courses (if not stated otherwise), and that&#39;s when I&#39;ll mark your submitted revisions.</p><p>The reason we only mark your work at specific deadlines is to avoid students submitting revisions with small changes again, and again, and again, until it&#39;s good enough to pass. It takes too much time for us teachers to mark revisions. By only marking your work at specific deadlines we:</p><ul><li>Encourage students to submit proper work (since most of them don&#39;t want to wait until the next submission occasion to receive a passing grade)</li><li>Avoid wasting time on marking unnecessary many revisions</li></ul>', 15);
