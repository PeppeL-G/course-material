Try to be creative and come up with an application someone wants to use, i.e. an application that solves a real-world problem of some kind. You could for example create an application for an organization you are member of (e.g. a football organization that needs to keep track of members, leaders, teams, training sessions, etc.), or simply an application you would like to use yourself. You can also try asking your family and friends if they need an Android application with some functionality that doesn&#39;t exist today.</p><p>Another way to come up with an application is to think of something you find boring/dangerous/time consuming, and then try to make it fun/safe/avoid it completely by using an Android application. For example, most people find it boring to wait in line. Maybe you can create an application that makes it fun to wait in line? Or an application that entirely eliminates the need to wait in line?</p><h3 id="suggestions" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#suggestions" aria-hidden="true">#</a> Suggestions</h3><p>At the bottom of this page you find the chapter <em>Project idea: Flee Market Manager</em> that describes a real-world problem you can try to solve by creating an Android application. It can also be used as a guideline for how &quot;complicated&quot;/&quot;complex&quot; the application you create needs to be.</p><p>Another idea is to create an application that can control an embedded system of some kind (dish washer, microwave, robot vacuum cleaner, etc.), for example using Bluetooth. Feel free to create your own embedded system. It can for example be a simple prototype used as a proof of concept. For example, your application might be about controlling a smart lock on a door (a lock that can be locked/unlocked with a smartphone using Bluetooth), but you don&#39;t have any smart lock, so then you create your own embedded system that simulates one, e.g. one that consists of a Bluetooth module and a LED lamp that is turned on/off to indicate if the door is locked or not. <strong>The embedded system can also be simulated as another Android application running on another Android device, e.g. an application showing a red/green circle indicating if the smart lock is locked or not, and this enables you to create a Android application that communicates with any type of embedded system you can think of!</strong></p><div class="custom-container warning"><p class="custom-container-title">Note</p><p>You will not get any credits for doing things not related to the intended learning outcomes in this course.

These exists in different variations, but things that usually are sold at a flea market includes:</p><ul><li>Used things</li><li>Cheap things</li><li>Home made things</li></ul><p>The people who sell things at the flea market usually need to pay the flea market organizer some money for selling their things at the market. There exist different pricing models for this, such as:</p><ul><li>A fixed amount of money (e.g. 5 SEK/sold item or 5 SEK/month).</li><li>A percentage of what they sell for (e.g. 5% of the price of each sold item).</li></ul><p>An example of a flea market in Sweden is a Klädbytardag (&quot;exchanging of clothes day&quot;). Those work like this:</p><ol><li>A parent that wishes to sell her children&#39;s outgrown clothes at the Klädbytardagen register itself at the flea market organizer.</li><li>The flea market organizer gives the parent a unique parent number (such as 1, 2, 3, and so on).</li><li>The parent puts notes on the children&#39;s clothes that should be sold at the flea market containing the unique parent number and the price the clothes should be sold for (whole SEK such as 5, 10, 22, and similar).</li><li>The parent hands over the children&#39;s clothes to the flea market organizer.</li><li>At the flea market day, customers (other parents) can come to organizer&#39;s facility to browse and buy clothes other parents have handed over.</li><li>At the checkout, the flea market organizer looks at the notes on the clothes the customer wants to buy to compute what the customer needs to pay and to remember how much each parent has sold their clothes for.</li><li>At the end of the day, each parent can come to the flea market and collect their clothes that weren&#39;t sold and the money they have earned for their clothes that was sold. The flea market organizer keeps 20% of the money, so the parent only gets back 80% of what her clothes was sold for.</li></ol><p>At the checkout, an Android app could be used to keep track of which clothes (and for how much) a parent has sold clothes for, and how much each customer should pay. At the end of the day, an Android app could also be used to compute how much each parent should get back for the sold clothes. To do this in a good way, the Android app could also be responsible for keeping track of which parents that are selling things, and which their unique parent numbers are.</p><h3 id="challenges-opportunities" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#challenges-opportunities" aria-hidden="true">#</a> Challenges / &quot;Opportunities&quot;</h3><h4 id="synchronizing-data" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#synchronizing-data" aria-hidden="true">#</a> Synchronizing data</h4><p>There usually exists multiple checkouts at the market place, and each checkout will have one device running the Android application. At the end of the day, when computing how much each parent has sold, all data about the selling needs to be accessible from a single device. This means that the data either:</p><ul><li>Needs to be stored at a centralized place, such as a Firestore database. As you understand, it is important that the Android application still can function and register which clothes that has been sold without an Internet connection.</li><li>Needs to be synchronized across multiple devices running the application at the end of the day (Bluetooth?).</li></ul><h4 id="using-the-camera" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#using-the-camera" aria-hidden="true">#</a> Using the camera</h4><p>One possibility is to not only store the name of the parent in the application/Firebase, but also a picture of the parent taken with the camera on the device. This could be useful for the organizers to identify parents.</p><p>Another possibility might be to replace the unique parent numbers with QR codes. This could speed up the checkout process (scanning the QR code with a camera instead of entering the seller number manually). Maybe the price for the clothes could be read by the camera as well somehow?</p><h4 id="using-tags" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#using-tags" aria-hidden="true">#</a> Using Tags</h4><p>Instead of using QR codes, maybe RFID/Bluetooth tags can be used to speed up the checkout process?</p>', 17);
